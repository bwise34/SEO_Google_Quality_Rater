# Introduction to Search Quality Rating


## 0.0 The Search Experience


The World Wide Web is a vast collection of online information and content. Internet search engines provide a powerful way to explore this online universe. There are many ways people search: people may type words into a search box in a browser, speak to a mobile phone or assistant device, use search engine autocomplete features, etc. People search the Internet for a variety of purposes, ranging from accomplishing a quick task to researching a topic in depth. A search may be part of a long-term project, such as a home remodel or vacation planning. A search may be done when someone is bored and looking for entertainment, such as a search for [funny videos]. A search may be a single question asked during a critical moment of a person's life, such as [what are the symptoms of a heart attack?].


Search engines exist to help people find what they are looking for. To do that, search engines must provide a diverse set of helpful, high-quality search results, presented in the most helpful order.


Different types of searches need very different types of search results. Medical search results should be high quality, authoritative, and trustworthy. Search results for [cute baby animal pictures] should be adorable. Search results for a specific website or webpage should have that desired result at the top. Searches that have many possible meanings or involve many perspectives need a diverse set of results that reflect the natural diversity of meanings and points of view.


People all over the world use search engines; therefore, diversity in search results is essential to satisfy the diversity of people who use search.


Finally, search results should help people. Search results should provide authoritative and trustworthy information, not lead people astray with misleading content. Search results should allow people to find what they're looking for, not surprise people with unpleasant, upsetting, offensive, or disturbing content. Harmful, hateful, violent, or sexually explicit search results are only appropriate if the person phrased their search in a way that makes it clear that they are looking for this type of content, and there is no other reasonable interpretation of the words used in their search.


## 0.1 The Purpose of Search Quality Rating


As a Search Quality Rater, you will help evaluate search engine quality around the world. Good search engines give results that are helpful for people in their own specific language and locale.


No single rating can directly impact how a particular webpage, website, or result appears in Google Search, nor can it cause specific webpages, websites, or results to move up or down on the search results page. Using ratings to position results on the search results page would not be feasible, as humans could never individually rate each page on the open web.


Instead, ratings are used to measure how effectively search engines are working to deliver helpful content to people around the world. Ratings are also used to improve search engines by providing examples of helpful and unhelpful results for different searches.


As part of your role in the search quality rating program, it is important that you are familiar with and comfortable using a search engine. We encourage you to be an expert in search! For example, experiment with using operators (e.g., quotes or a hyphen) in your searches or try using advanced search options.


## 0.2 Raters Must Represent People in their Rating Locale


It is very important for you to represent people in the locale you evaluate. You must be very familiar with the task language and location in order to represent the experience of people in your locale. If you do not have the knowledge to do this, please inform your employer/company.


Unless your rating task indicates otherwise, your ratings should be based on the instructions and examples given in these guidelines. Ratings should not be based on your personal opinions, preferences, religious beliefs, or political views. Always use your best judgment and represent the cultural standards of your rating locale.


Check with your employer/company for browser requirements. You may use helpful browser add-ons or extensions, but please do not use add-ons or extensions that interfere with or alter the user experience of the page.


## 0.3 Browser Requirements


## 0.4 Ad Blocking Extensions


Do not use add-ons or extensions that block ads for Needs Met rating or Page Quality rating. These add-ons or extensions may cause you to give incorrect ratings. As a rater, only use an ad blocking extension or add-on if specifically instructed to do so in the project-specific instructions.


## 0.5 Internet Safety Information


In the course of your work, you will visit many different webpages. Some of them may harm your computer unless you are careful. Please do not download any executables, applications, or other potentially dangerous files, or click on any links that you are uncomfortable with.


It is strongly recommended that you have antivirus and antispyware protection on your computer. This software must be updated frequently or your computer will not be protected. There are many free and for-purchase antivirus and antispyware products available on the web. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software) for a Wikipedia page on antivirus software and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyware) for a Wikipedia page on spyware.


We suggest that you only open files with which you are comfortable. The file formats listed below are generally considered safe if antivirus software is in place. 


- .txt (text files)
- .ppt or .pptx (Microsoft PowerPoint)
- .doc or .docx (Microsoft Word)
- .xls or .xlsx (Microsoft Excel)
- .pdf (PDF files) (Adobe Acrobat)


If you encounter a page with a warning message, such as “Warning-visiting this web site may harm your computer,” or if your antivirus software warns you about a page, you should not try to visit the page to assign a rating.


## 0.6 The Role of Examples in these Guidelines


The rating concepts in these guidelines apply to all types of content. The examples throughout these guidelines are very important to illustrate how the concepts defined in each section should be applied in rating tasks for different types of webpages and different types of content.


Please view each example and keep the following in mind:


- Webpages and websites change rapidly, so we use images or "snapshots" of webpages in most of our examples. Because some types of content are difficult to view in "snapshot" form, a description of the webpage is provided for each example.
- The information in the examples was accurate at the time it was added, but content and websites may change over time.
- Some examples show pages on desktop and some show pages on mobile devices.

## Part 1: Page Quality Rating Guideline


### 1.0 Introduction to Page Quality Rating


A Page Quality (PQ) rating task consists of a URL and a grid to record your observations as you explore the landing page and the website associated with the URL. The goal of PQ rating is to evaluate how well the page achieves its purpose.


Here's what you'll need to be a successful Page Quality rater:


- Your experience using the web as an ordinary user in your rating locale.
- In-depth knowledge of these guidelines.
- And most importantly—practice doing PQ rating tasks!


### 2.0 Understanding Webpages and Websites


Page Quality rating requires an in-depth understanding of websites. We'll start with the basics. Along the way, we'll share important information about Page Quality rating, so please read through this section even if you are a website expert!


#### 2.1 Important Definitions


Here are some important definitions:


A **search engine** is a tool to help people find or interact with content available on the Internet. In these guidelines, the word "user" refers to a person trying to find information or accomplish a task on the Internet. Users are people from many different backgrounds, whose experiences and needs may differ from your own: people of all ages, genders, races, religions, political affiliations, etc.


A **webpage** is connected to the World Wide Web and can be viewed or "visited" using a web browser (e.g., Chrome), a browser on your phone, or a search app. In the 1990s, webpage content was mostly text and links. Today, webpage content includes many forms of media (such as images, videos, etc.) and functionality (such as online shopping features, email, calculator functionality, online games, etc.).


A **URL** is a string of letters, numbers, and punctuation that your web browser uses to “find” and display a webpage. Page Quality rating doesn't require you to have an in-depth understanding of the structure of URLs, i.e., you don’t need to know the difference between host, domain, etc. But if you are interested, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) to read more.


A **website** or **site** is a group of World Wide Web pages usually containing hyperlinks to each other and made available online by an individual, company, educational institution, government, or organization. Popular websites include Facebook, Wikipedia, Yahoo, YouTube, etc.


**Note**: In these guidelines, we will use the word “website” to refer to a collection of pages owned and controlled by a single entity (individual, business, etc.). But we will also use “website” to refer to major “independent” sections (or hosts) of some websites that were created to achieve separate purposes. For example, the Yahoo website is organized into different sections (or hosts), such as Yahoo Finance (finance.yahoo.com), Yahoo Mail (mail.yahoo.com), Yahoo Sports (sports.yahoo.com), etc. Each of these has its own purpose. It’s OK to refer to each of these sections as a website; for example, the Yahoo Finance website and the Yahoo Sports website. You may also refer to pages on Yahoo Finance or Yahoo Sports as belonging to the Yahoo website.


A **homepage** of a website is the main page of the site. It is usually the first page that users see when the site loads. For example, [http://www.apple.com](http://www.apple.com) is the homepage of the Apple site, [http://www.yahoo.com](http://www.yahoo.com) is the homepage of the Yahoo company site, and [http://finance.yahoo.com](http://finance.yahoo.com) is the homepage of Yahoo Finance. You can usually find the homepage of a website by clicking on a “home” link or logo link on subpages of a website.


A **website owner** is the person, company, or organization who is responsible for a website.


A **content creator** is the individual(s) or entity (business, organization, etc.) who created the content on a webpage.


**Important**: You must be very comfortable exploring websites, both by clicking links and modifying URLs in the address bar of your web browser. Become a website detective and explorer!


#### 2.2 Understanding the Purpose of a Webpage


The purpose of a page is the reason or reasons why the page was created. Every page on the Internet is created for a purpose, or for multiple purposes. Most pages are created to be helpful for people, thus having a beneficial purpose.


Some pages are created merely to make money, with little or no effort to help people. Some pages are even created to harm users. The first step in understanding a page is figuring out its purpose.


Why is it important to determine the purpose of the page for PQ rating?


- The goal of PQ rating is to determine how well a page achieves its purpose. In order to assign a rating, you must understand the purpose of the page and sometimes the website.
- By understanding the purpose of the page, you'll better understand what criteria are important to consider when evaluating that particular page.
- Websites and pages should be created to help people. If that is not the case, a rating of Lowest may be warranted. More on this later.


As long as the page is created to help people, we will not consider any particular page purpose or type to be higher quality than another. For example, encyclopedia pages are not necessarily higher quality than humor pages.


**Important**: There are highest quality and lowest quality webpages of all different types and purposes: shopping pages, news pages, forum pages, video pages, pages with error messages, PDFs, images, gossip pages, humor pages, homepages, and all other types of pages. The type of page does not determine the PQ rating—you have to understand the purpose of the page to determine the rating.


Common helpful or beneficial page purposes include (but are not limited to):


- To share information about a topic.
- To share a personal experience, perspective, or feelings on a topic.
- To share pictures, videos, or other forms of media.
- To demonstrate a personal talent or skill.
- To express an opinion or point of view.
- To entertain.
- To offer products or services.
- To allow users to post questions for other users to answer.
- To allow users to share files or to download software.


Here are a few examples where it is easy to understand the purpose of the page:


| Type of Page | Purpose of the Page |
|--------------|---------------------|
| News website homepage | To inform users about recent or important events. |
| Shopping page | To sell or give information about the product. |
| Video page | To share a cute video of a cat. |
| Currency converter page | To calculate equivalent amounts in different currencies. |


Here is an example (OmNomNomNom Page) of a helpful page where the purpose of the page is not as obvious. At first glance, this page may seem pointless or strange. However, it is a page from a humorous site that encourages users to.post photos with mouths drawn on them. The purpose of the page is humor or artistic expression. This page has a helpful or beneficial purpose. Even though the About page on this website is not very helpful, the website explains itself on its FAQ page.


#### 2.3 Your Money or Your Life (YMYL) Topics


Pages on the World Wide Web are about a vast variety of topics. Some topics have a high risk of harm because content about these topics could significantly impact the health, financial stability, or safety of people, or the welfare or well-being of society. We call these topics “Your Money or Your Life” or YMYL.


YMYL topics may significantly impact or harm one or more of the following:


- The person who is directly viewing or using the content.
- Other people who are affected by the person who viewed the content.
- Groups of people or society affected by the actions of people who viewed the content.


YMYL topics can directly and significantly impact people’s health, financial stability or safety, or the welfare or well-being of society, because of the following reasons:


- **The topic itself is harmful or dangerous**. For example, there is clear and present harm directly associated with topics related to self-harm, criminal acts, or violent extremism.
- **The topic could cause harm if the content is not accurate and trustworthy**. For example, mild inaccuracies or content from less reliable sources could significantly impact someone's health, financial stability, or safety, or impact society, for topics like: symptoms of a heart attack, how to invest money, what to do if there is an earthquake, who can vote, or needed qualifications for obtaining a driver’s license.


To determine whether a topic is YMYL, assess the following types of harm that might occur:


- **YMYL Health or Safety**: Topics that could harm mental, physical, and emotional health, or any form of safety such as physical safety or safety online.
- **YMYL Financial Security**: Topics that could damage a person's ability to support themselves and their families.
- **YMYL Society**: Topics that could negatively impact groups of people, issues of public interest, trust in public institutions, etc.
- **YMYL Other**: Topics that could hurt people or negatively impact welfare or well-being of society.


It's possible to imagine a hypothetical harmful page for any non-harmful topic, such as the science behind rainbows or shopping for pencils: for either of these topics, someone could build a page that has a malicious computer virus download. However, for a specific topic to be YMYL, the topic itself must potentially impact people’s health, financial stability, or safety, or the welfare or well-being of society.


Many or most topics are not YMYL and do not require a high level of accuracy or trust to prevent harm. Because YMYL assessment is a spectrum, it may be helpful to think of topics as clear YMYL, definitely not YMYL or something in between. Pages on clear YMYL topics require the most scrutiny for Page Quality rating.


| Type of Topic | Clear YMYL Topic | May be YMYL Topic | Not or Unlikely YMYL Topic |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Information | Evacuation routes for a tsunami. Explanation: Inaccurate information on evacuation routes could cause significant harm to people. | Weather forecast. Explanation: In most situations, slightly inaccurate information about the weather forecast will not cause harm. People often ask family members "What's the weather today?" | Music award winners. Explanation: This topic is unlikely to cause harm. |
| Advice about an activity | When to go to the emergency. Explanation: Bad advice on when to go to the emergency room could cause significant harm. | How often to replace a toothbrush. Explanation: This is a casual health topic people commonly discuss with friends. A slightly imperfect suggestion is unlikely to significantly impact health or safety. | How frequently to wash jeans. Explanation: This topic is unlikely to cause harm. |
| A personal opinion | Personal opinion about why a racial group is inferior. Explanation: Pages on this topic have been used to justify or incite violence against groups of people. | Personal opinion about why an exercise is inferior. Explanation: While there may be a health concern if the exercise is extreme or risky, most discussions of jogging vs swimming, etc. involve personal preference. | Personal opinion about why a rock band is inferior. Explanation: This topic is unlikely to cause harm, although there may be strong opinions involved! |
| News about current events | News about ongoing violence. Explanation: People need accurate information to stay safe. Society may also be impacted by information about ongoing violence, as citizens and governments make civic decisions accordingly. | News about a car accident. Explanation: The accident itself may have been harmful, but there is likely little risk of future harm from small inaccuracies in reporting about an incident. | News about a local high school basketball game. Explanation: This topic is unlikely to cause harm. |
| Sharing on social media | A tide pod challenge post. Explanation: This harmful social media challenge was responsible for deaths. | A hot sauce challenge. Explanation: While some people may experience some discomfort by tasting various hot sauces, it is unlikely that sharing about such challenges would cause significant harm. | A music video. Explanation: This type of content generally has little risk of harm. |
| Online commerce and product reviews | Purchasing prescription drugs. Explanation: Prescription drugs have the potential to cause harm and require purchase from licensed pharmacies. | Review of a type of car. Explanation: While cars are big purchases, many people ask friends and family about cars. | Purchasing pencils. Explanation: Pencils and other everyday items are unlikely to cause harm. |


**Note**: If you are having trouble deciding whether a topic is YMYL, consider the following questions:


1. Would a careful person seek out experts or highly trusted sources to prevent harm? Could even minor inaccuracies cause harm? If yes, then the topic is likely YMYL.
2. Is the specific topic one that most people would be content with only casually consulting their friends about? If yes, the topic is likely not YMYL. 


**Important**: For pages about clear YMYL topics, we have very high Page Quality rating standards because low-quality pages on such topics could potentially negatively impact a person’s health, financial stability, or safety, or the welfare or well-being of society.


### 2.4 Understanding Webpage Content


All of the content on a webpage can be classified as one of the following: Main Content (MC), Supplementary Content (SC), or Advertisements/Monetization (Ads). In order to understand the purpose of a webpage and do PQ rating, you will need to be able to distinguish among these different parts of the page.


Webpage design can be complicated, so make sure to click around and explore the page. See what kind of content is behind the tabs and test out the interactive page features. Content behind the tabs may be considered part of the MC, SC, or Ads, depending on what the content is.


#### 2.4.1 Identifying the Main Content (MC)


Main Content is any part of the page that directly helps the page achieve its purpose. MC can be text, images, videos, page features (e.g., calculators, games), and it can be content created by website users, such as videos, reviews, articles, comments posted by users, etc. Tabs on some pages lead to even more information (e.g., customer reviews) and can sometimes be considered part of the MC.


The MC also includes the title at the top of the page. Descriptive MC titles allow users to make informed decisions about what pages to visit. Helpful titles summarize the MC on the page.


| Type of Page and Purpose | MC Highlighted in Yellow |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| News website homepage: the purpose is to inform users about recent or important events. | ![MC - News Homepage](MC - News Homepage.png) |
| News article page: the purpose is to communicate information about an event or news topic. | ![MC - News Article](MC - News Article.png) |
| Store product page: the purpose is to sell or give information about the product. | ![MC - Shopping Page](MC - Shopping Page.png) |
| Currency converter page: the purpose is to calculate equivalent amounts in different currencies. | ![MC - Currency Converter](MC - Currency Converter.png) |
| Blog post page: the purpose is to share music used on a TV show. | ![MC - Blog Post Page](MC - Blog Post Page.png) |
| Search engine homepage: the purpose is to allow users to enter a query and search the Internet. | ![MC - Search Engine Homepage](MC - Search Engine Homepage.png) |
| Bank login page: the purpose is to allow users to log in to bank online. | ![MC - Bank Login Page](MC - Bank Login Page.png) |


#### 2.4.2 Identifying the Supplementary Content (SC)


Supplementary Content contributes to a good user experience on the page, but does not directly help the page achieve its purpose. SC is an important part of the user experience. One common type of SC is navigation links that allow users to visit other parts of the website. In some cases, content behind tabs may be considered part of the SC.


Sometimes the easiest way to identify SC is to look for the parts of the page that are not MC or Ads.


| Type of Page and Purpose | SC Highlighted in Blue |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| News article page: the purpose is to communicate information about an event or news topic. | ![SC - News Article](SC - News Article.png) |
| Store product page: the purpose is to sell or give information about the product. | ![SC - Shopping Page](SC - Shopping Page.png) |
| Blog post page: the purpose is to share music used on a TV show. | ![SC - Blog Post Page](SC - Blog Post Page.png) |


#### 2.4.3 Identifying Advertisements/Monetization (Ads)


Ads may contribute to a good user experience. Advertisements/Monetization (Ads) is content and/or links that are displayed for the purpose of monetizing (making money from) the page. The presence or absence of Ads is not by itself a reason for a High or Low quality rating. Without advertising and monetization, some webpages could not exist because it costs money to maintain a website and create high-quality content.


There are many different ways to monetize a webpage, including advertisements and affiliate programs. Note that monetization on mobile pages may be more subtle than monetization on desktop pages.


The most common type of monetization is advertisements. Ads may be labeled as "ads," "sponsored links," "sponsored listings,” “sponsored results,” etc. Ads may change when you reload the page, and different users may see different Ads on the same page.


Website owners can choose to display Ads on their page (such as by joining an advertising network), but they may not always directly control the content of the Ads. However, we will consider a website responsible for the overall quality of the Ads displayed.


**Important**: For the purpose of these guidelines, we will consider monetized links of any type to be “Ads.”


| Type of Page and Purpose | Ads Highlighted in Red |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| News article page: the purpose is to communicate information about an event or news topic. | ![Ads - News Article](Ads - News Article.png) |
| Blog post page: the purpose is to share music used on a TV show. | ![Ads - Blog Post Page](Ads - Blog Post Page.png) |
| Store product page: the purpose is to sell or give information about the product. | ![No ads – Shopping Page](No ads – Shopping Page.png) |


#### 2.4.4 Summary of the Parts of the Page


Let's put it all together.


- **Main Content (MC)** is any part of the page that directly helps the page achieve its purpose. MC is (or should be!) the reason the page exists. The quality of the MC plays a very large role in the Page Quality rating of a webpage.
- **Supplementary Content (SC)** is also important. SC can help a page better achieve its purpose or it can detract from the overall experience.
- Many pages have **advertisements/monetization (Ads)**. Without advertising and monetization, some webpages could not exist because it costs money to maintain a website and create high-quality content. The presence or absence of Ads is not by itself a reason for a High or Low quality rating.


On some pages, user reviews and comments may be considered MC, and on other pages they may be considered SC. Use your best judgment and think about the purpose of the page.


Do not worry too much about identifying every little part of the page. Think about which parts of the page are the MC. Next, look for the Ads. Anything left over can be considered SC.


| Type of Page and Purpose | MC, SC, & Ads Highlighted |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| News article page: the purpose is to communicate information about an event or news topic. | ![Summary - News Article](Summary - News Article.png) |
| Store product page: the purpose is to sell or give information about the product. | ![Summary - Shopping Page](Summary - Shopping Page.png) |
| Currency converter page: the purpose is to calculate equivalent amounts in different currencies. | ![Summary - Currency Converter](Summary - Currency Converter.png) |
| Blog post page: the purpose is to share music used on a TV show. | ![Summary - Blog Post Page](Summary - Blog Post Page.png) |
| Bank login page: the purpose is to allow users to log in to the bank online. | ![Summary - Bank Login Page](Summary - Bank Login Page.png) |


### 2.5 Understanding the Website


Pages often make more sense when viewed as part of a website. Some of the criteria in Page Quality rating are based on understanding the website that the page belongs to.


To understand a website, start by finding out who is responsible for the website and who created the content on the page (more information provided in Section 2.5.2). Then, look for information about the website and/or content creators on the website itself. Websites and content creators are usually very eager to tell you all about themselves!


You must also look for reputation information about the website and/or content creators. What do outside, independent sources say about them? When there is disagreement between what the website or content creators say about themselves and what reputable independent sources say, trust the independent sources.


#### 2.5.1 Finding the Homepage


The homepage of a website usually contains or has links to important information about the website. Website owners usually make it easy to get to the homepage from any page on the site.


Here's how to find the homepage of a website:


1. Examine the landing page of the URL in your PQ rating task.
2. Find and click on the link labeled with the name or logo of the website (occasionally labeled as “home" or “main"), which usually appears at the top of the page.


Sometimes, you may be given a webpage or website that appears to have no navigation links, no homepage link, and no logo or other means to find the homepage. Even some High or Highest quality pages lack a way to navigate to the homepage. If you can't find a link to the homepage, modify the URL by removing everything to the right of “.com,” “.org,” “.net,” “.fr,” etc. and refresh the page.


Occasionally, your rating task will include a URL for which there are two or more justifiable “homepage” candidates. For example, you may not be sure whether the homepage of the URL [https://finance.yahoo.com/calendar](https://finance.yahoo.com/calendar) is [http://finance.yahoo.com](http://finance.yahoo.com) or [http://www.yahoo.com](http://www.yahoo.com).


**Important**: When you have more than one homepage “candidate,” please use whichever one offers the most information about the specific webpage in the rating task. Use your judgment. The goal is to understand the webpage and the website(s) it is associated with, not find the one unique, correct homepage.


In the following examples, we have included the URL of the page to be evaluated in the rating task, as well as the URL of its associated homepage. We have also included an image that shows where to click on the landing page to navigate to the homepage. In the image, you will see a red box around the link or logo you would click to navigate to the homepage.


| URL of the Task Page | Homepage of the Website | Where to click to get to the Homepage |
|----------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| [http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/shun-premier-7-piece-knife-block-set](http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/shun-premier-7-piece-knife-block-set) | [http://www.williams-sonoma.com](http://www.williams-sonoma.com) | This “WILLIAMS-SONOMA” logo shown in the upper center of the page is clickable and takes users to the homepage of the website. |
| [http://hms.harvard.edu/about-hms/facts-figures](http://hms.harvard.edu/about-hms/facts-figures) | [http://hms.harvard.edu](http://hms.harvard.edu) | In this case, we will consider the Harvard Medical School page at [http://hms.harvard.edu](http://hms.harvard.edu) to be the homepage, rather than [http://www.harvard.edu](http://www.harvard.edu) (which is the homepage of Harvard University). Clicking the logo at the top of [http://hms.harvard.edu/about-hms/facts-figures](http://hms.harvard.edu/about-hms/facts-figures) takes users to [http://hms.harvard.edu](http://hms.harvard.edu), not to [http://www.harvard.edu](http://www.harvard.edu).


#### 2.5.2 Finding Who is Responsible for the Website and Who Created the Content on the Page


Every page belongs to a website, and it should be clear:


- Who (what individuals, company, business, organization, government agency, etc.) is responsible for the website.
- Who (what individuals, company, business, organization, government agency, etc.) created the content on the page you are evaluating. Note that for pages on websites such as forums and social media platforms, people may post content using an alias or username in order to avoid sharing personally identifiable information online. In these cases, the alias or username is an acceptable way to identify the content creator.


Websites are usually very clear about who is responsible for the website and who created the content on the page. There are many reasons for this:


- People may want to showcase their own personal talent, experiences, and perspectives.
- Artists, authors, musicians, and other original content creators may want to be known and appreciated.
- Commercial websites may have copyrighted material they want to protect.
- Businesses and organizations may want people to know who they are and what they do.
- Stores want customers to feel comfortable buying their products online.


Most websites have “contact us” or “about us” or “about” pages that provide information about who owns the site. Many companies have an entire website or blog devoted to who they are and what they are doing, what jobs are available, etc.


Here are some examples:


- [Google Official Blog](https://blog.google.com)
- [Marriott Blog](https://marriottbonvoy.marriott.com)
- [Southwest Airlines Blog](https://community.southwest.com)
- [Netflix Tech Blog](https://netflixtechblog.com)


In PQ rating tasks, you will need to identify who created the MC on the page. To help you do so, the table below describes the primary content creators for common webpage types. These types can overlap (e.g., a page may have multiple articles, some written by individual authors or journalists and others written by the website owner).


| Webpage Type | Examples | Primary Content Creator(s) |
|--------------|----------|----------------------------|
| The website owner created the page and much of the MC on the page. The page may have comments, reviews, or other content posted by users, but the page itself is the responsibility of the website. | - Homepage of a business website - Introductory page on a personal website - Product page on an online merchant website | The website itself can be viewed as the primary content creator. Website owners may have content created on their behalf (e.g., a small business may hire a professional web developer to build their website), but they are ultimately responsible for the MC. User comments and reviews may play a significant role on the page. As long as the website creates and actively maintains the page, the website is considered to be the primary content creator. |
| The website owner created the page, and the MC is produced by authors or other content creators identified by the website. The website decides what to publish and is responsible for the content, but there are distinct authors or content creators who provide the MC on the page. | - Newspaper opinion piece written by the editorial board - Magazine article written by an individual journalist - Scientific journal paper written by a team of academic researchers | The primary content creators are the journalists, scientists, etc. listed as authors of the content. Often the content creators are individuals, but an organization, company, or institution may also be the content creator. User comments may be present, but they typically are not the focus of the page. |
| The webpage consists of social media post(s) from a single account representing an individual content creator or organization. The social media website owner enables people and organizations to create accounts to post text, images, videos, and other types of content under their account. The webpage is created by multiple users engaging in discussion or posting on social media. | - Social media post - Local business profile page on a social media website - Video channel on a video sharing website - Forum discussion thread - Q&A question page - Search results page on a social media website showing content from many different users | The primary content creator is the person or organization who created the account and is posting the MC. There may be information about the content creator on a profile page found on the website. Other user comments and reactions such as "likes" may be considered part of the MC. The people posting are the content creators. There is no single primary content creator, and people may be identified only by aliases or usernames. |


#### 2.5.3 Finding About Us, Contact Information, and Customer Service Information


Many websites are interested in communicating with their users. There are many reasons that users might have for contacting a website, from reporting problems such as broken pages, to asking for content removal. Many websites offer multiple ways for users to contact the website: email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, web contact forms, etc. Sometimes, this contact information is even organized by department and provides the names of individuals to contact.


The types and amount of contact information needed depend on the type of website. Contact information and customer service information are extremely important for websites that handle money, such as stores, banks, credit card companies, etc. Users need a way to ask questions or get help when a problem occurs.


For shopping websites, we'll ask you to do some special checks. Look for contact information—including the store’s policies on payment, exchanges, and returns. Sometimes this information is listed under “customer service.”


Some kinds of websites need fewer details and a smaller amount of contact information for their purpose. For example, humor websites may not need the level of detailed contact information we would expect from online banking websites.


Occasionally, you may encounter a website or content creator with a legitimate reason for anonymity. For example, personal websites may omit personal contact information such as an individual’s home address or phone number. Similarly, websites with user-generated content may allow the author to identify themself with an alias or username only.


To find contact or customer service information for a website, start with the homepage. Look for a “contact us” or “customer service” link. Explore the website if you cannot find a “contact us” page. Sometimes you will find the contact information on a “corporate site” link or even on the company’s official social media page. Be a detective!


Note that different locales and different social media platforms may have their own conventions and standards for what information should be available on the website. Please use your judgment and knowledge of your locale.

# 3.0 Overall Page Quality Rating


Now that you are an expert in understanding websites and webpages, here are the high-level steps of Page Quality rating:


1. Assess the true purpose of the page. If the website or page has a harmful purpose or is designed to deceive people about its true purpose, it should be rated Lowest.
2. Assess the potential of the page to cause harm as described in these guidelines. Websites or pages that are harmful to people or society, untrustworthy, or spammy as defined in these guidelines should be rated Lowest.
3. Otherwise, the PQ rating is based on how well the page achieves its purpose as described in these guidelines.


**Important**: There are harmful pages that are seemingly “official”, “expert”, or “authoritative”. Any type of website may have pages with harmful MC, from user-uploaded videos and forum posts to harmful products sold online to pages that mimic the look of scientific papers or encyclopedia entries. All pages should be evaluated for harm—including pages on government websites, academic institutions, reputable online stores, charities, or other types of generally helpful websites.


On Page Quality rating tasks, you will use the Page Quality sliding scale (slider) to assign the overall PQ rating. The slider looks like this:


![Page Quality Slider](PQ_Slider.png)


You may also use the in-between ratings of Lowest+, Low+, Medium+, and High+. Please interpret the “+” as “+ ½,” meaning that the Lowest+ rating is halfway between Lowest and Low, Low+ is halfway between Low and Medium, etc.


Identifying Lowest and Low-quality pages can be the most difficult part of PQ rating. The guidance in the sections on Lowest and Low is more extensive to help you rate accurately. High and Highest quality pages are typically easier to identify, but be sure to apply the standards and examine the examples throughout these guidelines to help calibrate your ratings. As might be expected, Medium quality pages are commonly found online.


### 3.1 Page Quality Rating Considerations


The following table summarizes the things that you should consider in Page Quality rating. Upcoming sections of these guidelines will elaborate on these considerations and explain how they apply to pages across the PQ rating scale.


| Consideration | Why it's Important for Page Quality Rating |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| The purpose of the page | If the page has a harmful purpose, or if it is designed to deceive people about its true purpose or who is responsible for the content, it should be rated Lowest. Otherwise, PQ rating is the process of determining how well a page achieves its purpose. |
| The potential for the page or website to cause harm as described in these guidelines | Websites or pages that are harmful to people or society, untrustworthy, or spammy as described in these guidelines should be rated Lowest. |
| The topic of the page and the extent to which that topic is YMYL | The topic of the page helps determine the standards for your overall PQ assessment. Pages on YMYL topics have higher standards than pages on non-YMYL topics. |
| The type of website | Different types of websites and webpages have different expectations for PQ rating. For example, PQ expectations may differ for: - Small hobbyist websites vs. large corporate websites - Websites involving financial transactions vs. websites that do not require payment or collect personal information - Websites with content created by ordinary people on a volunteer basis vs. websites with content created by professionals |
| Information provided by the website and content creator | While the information that websites and content creators provide about themselves isn't always trustworthy, it can provide an important starting point. |
| Quality of the MC | Consider the extent to which the MC is satisfying and helps the page achieve its purpose. |
| The title of the page | The title of the page is considered part of the MC. Descriptive MC titles that summarize the page allow people to make informed decisions about what pages to visit. |
| The role of Ads and SC on the page | Consider the ways in which the Ads and SC contribute to how people experience the page. Remember: many websites need monetization to share content with users. The presence or absence of Ads alone is not a consideration for PQ rating. |
| Reputation of the website and content creator | Research the reputation of the website and the content creator to learn about how others view the website and who is behind it. |
| Trustworthiness of the page: E-E-A-T | Assess how trustworthy the page is. Experience, Expertise, and Authoritativeness can help with your assessment of Trust. Some types of pages require a high level of Trust. |


**Important**: These considerations overlap. For example, while examining the quality of the MC, you may notice factual inaccuracies that lower your assessment of Trust. While conducting reputation research, you may find information about the expertise of the content creator which increases your level of Trust. This is how PQ rating is designed to work!


### 3.2 Quality of the Main Content


The quality of the Main Content (MC) is one of the most important considerations for PQ rating. The MC plays a major role in determining how well a page achieves its purpose.


The unifying theme for evaluating the quality of the MC is the extent to which the MC allows the page to achieve its purpose and offers a satisfying user experience. For most pages, the quality of the MC can be determined by the amount of **effort**, **originality**, and **talent or skill** that went into the creation of the content. For informational pages and pages on YMYL topics, accuracy and consistency with well-established expert consensus is important.


- **Effort**: Consider the extent to which a human being actively worked to create satisfying content. Effort may be direct, such as a person translating a poem from one language to another. Effort may go into designing page functionality or building systems that power a webpage, such as the creation of a page that offers machine translation as a service to users. On the other hand, the automatic creation of thousands of pages by running existing freely available content through existing translation software without any oversight, manual curation, etc., would not be considered to have human effort. For pages like social media posts or forum discussions, the level of participation and depth of conversation is an important part of effort. Contributions from multiple individuals on such pages can add up to a significant amount of total human effort.
- **Originality**: Consider the extent to which the content offers unique, original content that is not available on other websites. If other websites have similar content, consider whether the page is the original source.
- **Talent or Skill**: Consider the extent to which the content is created with enough talent and skill to provide a satisfying experience for people who visit the page.
- **Accuracy**: For informational pages, consider the extent to which the content is factually accurate. For pages on YMYL topics, consider the extent to which the content is accurate and consistent with well-established expert consensus.


The purpose of the page, topic of the page, and type of website all play a role in how to evaluate the quality of the MC. For example, consistency with well-established expert consensus is important for medical advice. Skill is important for how-to videos. Talent and originality are important for artistic expression. The amount of effort expected for a short video shared on social media is less than for a full-length, professionally produced documentary on a streaming video website, but both need sufficient effort to create satisfying content for their purpose. Think about what effort, originality, talent, or skill looks like for the type of page that you are evaluating.


For each page you evaluate, spend a few minutes examining the MC before drawing a conclusion about it. Read the article, watch the video, examine the pictures, use the calculator, play the online game, etc. Remember that MC also includes page features and functionality, so test the page out. For example, if the page is a product page on a store website, put at least one product in the cart to make sure the shopping cart is functioning. If the page is an online game, try to play the game yourself. Do your best to imagine that you are someone who's very interested in the topic, functionality, or purpose served by the page, then think about how satisfying the MC would be for that person.


High and low-quality MC comes in all formats (e.g., text, audio, video, images) and all lengths (e.g., short-form videos and full-length professional documentaries). High and low-quality content also exists on all types of websites, from small personal sites to large corporate sites, from forums and social media to websites that handle financial transactions. Think carefully about what helps the page achieve its purpose and what makes the MC satisfying for users.


### 3.3 Reputation of the Website and Content Creators


An important part of PQ rating is understanding the reputation of the website. If the website is not the primary creator of the MC, it’s important to research the reputation of the content creator as well.


Reputation research should be performed according to the topic of the page. For example, if the page contains medical information, research the reputation of the website and content creator for providing medical information. It's possible for a website to be a go-to source for one type of content (e.g., humorous videos), but an untrustworthy source for a different type of content (e.g., financial information).


A website's or content creator's reputation can also help you understand what a website or content creator is best known for. For example, newspapers may be known for high quality, independent investigative reporting while satire websites may be known for their humor. An individual journalist (content creator) may be known for the clarity of their scientific articles while a food blogger (content creator) may be known for the deliciousness of the recipes they post online.


Note that a company or person may create content on many different websites. For example, a newspaper might have their own website, upload their video content to a video-sharing website, post updates on social media, and contribute content to a TV channel. An expert on a topic might publish research papers, have a lengthy blog, and share short updates on social media. In these cases, you should research the underlying company or content creator.


Reputation research is especially important for detecting untrustworthy websites and content creators. Content may look great on the surface, but reputation research can expose scams, fraud, or other signs of harm. You never know what you will find unless you look! Therefore, reputation research is required for all PQ rating tasks.


#### 3.3.1 Reputation of the Website


A website's reputation is based on the experience of real users and the opinions of people who are experts. Websites may represent real companies, organizations, and other entities. Reputation research applies to both the website and the actual company, organization, or entity that the website is representing.


Many websites are eager to tell users how great they are. Your job is to independently evaluate the Page Quality of the website, not just accept information that appears on one or two pages of the website without further verification. Be skeptical of claims that websites make about themselves, particularly when there is a clear conflict of interest.


Instead, look for independent reviews, references, recommendations by experts, news articles, and other sources of credible information about the website. Look for information written by a person or organization, not statistics or other machine-compiled information. News articles, Wikipedia articles, blog posts, magazine articles, forum discussions, and ratings from independent organizations can all be great sources of reputation information.


For YMYL topics, the reputation of a website should be judged by what experts in the field have to say. Recommendations from expert sources, such as professional societies, are strong evidence of a positive reputation.


Sources of reputation information will also vary according to the topic or type of company/organization/entity that the website represents. For example, you might find that a newspaper (with an associated website) has won journalistic awards. Prestigious awards or a history of high-quality original reporting are strong evidence of positive reputation for news websites.


Note that some types of information about a website are not related to its reputation. For example, websites like Similarweb have information about Internet traffic to the website, but do not provide evidence of positive or negative reputation. You can ignore this type of information since it's not helpful for PQ rating.


#### 3.3.2 Customer Reviews as Reputation Information


Customer reviews can be helpful for assessing the reputation of a store, business, or any website that offers products or services to users. You may consider a large number of detailed, trustworthy, positive user reviews as evidence of positive reputation for a store or business.


However, you should interpret customer reviews with care, particularly if there are only a few. Keep the following in mind:


- Be skeptical of both positive and negative reviews. Anyone can write them, including the website owner or someone whom the store or business hires for this purpose.
- Try to find as many reviews as possible. Any store or business can get a few negative reviews—this is completely normal and expected. Large stores and companies receive thousands of reviews, and most receive some negative ones.
- Read the reviews because the content of the reviews matters, not just the number or star rating. Credible, convincing reports of fraud and financial wrongdoing are evidence of extremely negative reputation. On the other hand, a single encounter with a rude clerk or the delayed receipt of a single package should not be considered negative reputation information. Please use your judgment.


#### 3.3.3 How to Search for Reputation Information about a Website


Here is how to research the reputation of the website:


1. Identify the “homepage” of the website. For example, for the IBM website, ibm.com is the homepage. You may need to identify the content creator if it is different from that of the overall website.
2. Using ibm.com as an example, try one or more of the following searches on Google:
    - [ibm -site:ibm.com] - A search for IBM that excludes pages on ibm.com.
    - [“ibm.com” -site:ibm.com] - A search for “ibm.com” that excludes pages on ibm.com.
    - [ibm reviews -site:ibm.com] - A search for reviews of IBM that excludes pages on ibm.com.
    - [“ibm.com” reviews -site:ibm.com] - A search for reviews of “ibm.com” that excludes pages on ibm.com.


**Note**: When searching for reputation information, try to find sources that were not written or created by the website or the company itself. For example, IBM might have official social media pages that it closely maintains, which would not be considered independent sources of reputation information about the company. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_sources) for a Wikipedia article on identifying and using independent sources.


3. Look for articles, references, recommendations by experts, and other credible information written by people about the website. High-quality news articles and informational articles may be good sources of reputation information. Search for such articles. For example, try [ibm site:en.wikipedia.org]. News articles and informational articles can help you learn about a company and may include information specific to reputation, such as awards and other forms of recognition, or also controversies and issues. Note that some informational articles include a message warning users that there are disagreements on some of the content, or that the content may be outdated. This may be an indication that additional research is necessary.
4. Make sure the information you find is appropriate for judging the reputation of the website. For example, reputation information for YMYL topics should come from sources that have expertise in the associated YMYL topic.


Here are some examples of reputation information:


| Website                        | Reputation Information About the Website                                              |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| annualcreditreport.com         | **Positive reputation information**: Users in the U.S. can obtain free credit reports on this website by providing their Social Security Number. Note that the Wikipedia article tells us that “AnnualCreditReport.com is the only federally mandated and authorized source for obtaining a free credit report.” |
| clevelandclinic.org            | **Positive reputation information**: According to Wikipedia, the Cleveland Clinic “is currently regarded as one of the top 4 hospitals in the United States” which can be confirmed by reputable news articles cited in the references section. Users can trust medical information on this website. |
| csmonitor.com                  | **Positive reputation information**: Notice the highlighted section in the Wikipedia article about The Christian Science Monitor newspaper, which tells us that the newspaper has won several prestigious awards. From this information, it can be inferred that the csmonitor.com website has a positive reputation. |
| kernel.org                     | **Positive reputation information**: According to the Wikipedia article, “Kernel.org is a main repository of source code for the Linux kernel, the base of the popular Linux operating system. It makes all versions of the source code available to all users. It also hosts various other projects, like Google Android. The main purpose of the site is to host a repository for Linux kernel developers.” |
| Site selling children’s jungle gym | **Extremely negative reputation information**: This website appears to be a perfectly fine-looking store; however, much evidence of negative reputation can be found. The business has a very low rating on a business review site. There is a news article about financial fraud. There are many reviews on different websites describing users sending money and not receiving anything. |
| Site selling products related to eyewear | **Extremely negative/malicious reputation information**: This website engaged in criminal behavior such as physically threatening users. |
| Organization serving the hospitalized veteran community | **Extremely negative reputation information**: There are many detailed negative articles on news sites and charity watchdog sites about this organization describing fraud and financial mishandling. |


#### 3.3.4 Reputation of the Content Creators


For individual authors and content creators, biographical information articles and online discussions can be a good source of reputation information. Expect to find more formal reputation information about people who create content in a journalistic, scientific, academic, or other traditionally professional capacity, as they often need online credibility for professional success. Educational degrees, peer validation, expert co-authors, and citations can be evidence of positive reputation information for professionals who publish their work. Employment history can also support a positive reputation for topics where training, credentials, or experience are important.


Influencers and other individual content creators who earn income on social media platforms often have reputation information available as well, ranging from biographical details or news articles to less formal reputation sources such as comments by other influencers in their fields.


For non-professional content creators including ordinary people who post on social media or forums, you may find informal reputation information on the page itself such as comments by other people about the creators. For example, you may find comments or posts from other users helpful to see what other people think about a particular content creator.


#### 3.3.5 What to Do When You Find No Reputation Information


You should expect to find some reputation information for large websites and well-known content creators. People or businesses who create content in a professional capacity typically have some reputation information available.


However, small websites may have little or no reputation information. This is not indicative of high or low quality. Many small local businesses or community organizations have a small “web presence” and rely on word of mouth.


Furthermore, many ordinary people participate in forum discussions or post on social media websites in a personal capacity. People may use an alias or username to post in order to avoid sharing personally identifiable information online. There may be no reputation information available for some individuals. A lack of reputation about people who post personal content is neither a positive nor a negative sign in your assessment of the page.


Finally, remember that there are several important considerations involved in PQ rating (refer back to Section 3.1). Reputation is important, but if reputation information is not available for a website or content creator, pay extra attention to other PQ considerations, especially when assessing pages on YMYL topics.


### 3.4 Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trust (E-E-A-T)


Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trust (E-E-A-T) are all important considerations in PQ rating. The most important member at the center of the E-E-A-T family is Trust.


- **Trust**: Consider the extent to which the page is accurate, honest, safe, and reliable. The type and amount of Trust needed depends on the page, for example:
  - **Online stores** need secure online payments systems and reliable customer service.
  - **Product reviews** should be honest and written to help others make informed purchasing decisions (rather than solely to sell the product).
  - **Informational pages on clear YMYL topics** must be accurate to prevent harm to people and society.
  - **Social media posts on non-YMYL topics** may not need a high level of Trust, such as when the purpose of the post is to entertain its audience and the content of the post does not risk causing harm.


Experience, Expertise, and Authoritativeness are important concepts that can support your assessment of Trust:


- **Experience**: Consider the extent to which the content creator has the necessary first-hand or life experience for the topic. Many types of pages are trustworthy and achieve their purpose well when created by people with a wealth of personal experience. For example, which would you trust: a product review from someone who has personally used the product or a "review" by someone who has not?


- **Expertise**: Consider the extent to which the content creator has the necessary knowledge or skill for the topic. Different topics require different levels and types of expertise to be trustworthy. For example, which would you trust: home electrical rewiring advice from a skilled electrician or from an antique homes enthusiast who has no knowledge of electrical wiring?


- **Authoritativeness**: Consider the extent to which the content creator or the website is known as a go-to source for the topic. While most topics do not have one official, authoritative website or content creator, when they do, that website or content creator is often among the most reliable and trustworthy sources. For example, a local business profile page on social media may be the authoritative and trusted source for what is on sale now. The official government page for getting a passport is the unique, official, and authoritative source for passport renewal.


Experience, Expertise, and Authoritativeness may overlap for some page types and topics (for example, someone may develop Expertise in a topic due to first-hand Experience accumulated over time), and different combinations of E-E-A may be relevant to different topics. You should consider the purpose, type, and topic of the page, then ask yourself what would make the content creator a trustworthy source in that context.


Trust is the most important member of the E-E-A-T family because untrustworthy pages have low E-E-A-T no matter how Experienced, Expert, or Authoritative they may seem. For example, a financial scam is untrustworthy, even if the content creator is a highly experienced and expert scammer who is considered the go-to on running scams!


When it comes to Page Quality rating, your assessment of E-E-A-T should be informed by one or more of the following:
- **What the website or content creators say about themselves**: Look at the "About us" page on the website or profile page of the content creator as a starting point. Is the website or content creator a trustworthy source based on this information?
  
- **What others say about the website or content creators**: Look for independent reviews, references, news articles, and other sources of credible information about the website or content creators. Is there independent, reliable evidence that the website or content creator is experienced, has expertise, is authoritative, or is otherwise considered trustworthy? Is there independent, reliable evidence that the website or creator is untrustworthy?


- **What is visible on the page, including the Main Content and sections such as reviews and comments**: For some types of pages, the level of experience and expertise may be clear from the MC itself. What evidence can you gather from examining the MC or testing the page out? For example, you may be able to tell that someone is an expert in hair styling by watching a video of them in action (styling someone's hair) and reading others' comments (commenters often highlight expertise or lack thereof).


Important: The website or content creator may not be a trustworthy source if there is a clear conflict of interest. For example, product reviews by people who own the product and share their experiences can be very valuable and trustworthy. However, "reviews" by the product manufacturer ("Our product is great!") or "reviews" from an influencer who is paid to promote the product are not as trustworthy due to the conflict of interest.


Finally, there are many aspects of Trust, some which are not captured by Experience, Expertise, and Authoritativeness. Please consider other aspects in your overall Trust assessment, such as customer service information for online stores or peer-reviewed publications for academic authors. If a page is untrustworthy for any reason, it has low E-E-A-T.


### 3.4.1 YMYL Topics: Experience or Expertise?


Pages on YMYL topics can be created for a wide variety of different purposes. If the purpose of a page on a clear YMYL topic is to give information or offer advice, a high level of expertise may be required for the page to be trustworthy.


However, sometimes pages on YMYL topics are created to share personal experiences, often regarding difficult life challenges. People turn to each other in times of need to share their own experience, seek comfort or inspiration, and learn from others. Factual information from experts and authoritative sources may not satisfy this need.


Pages that share first-hand life experience on clear YMYL topics may be considered to have high E-E-A-T as long as the content is trustworthy, safe, and consistent with well-established expert consensus. In contrast, some types of YMYL information and advice must come from experts.


Here are some examples:


| YMYL Topic | Valuable Sharing of Life Experience | Information or Advice Best Left to Experts |
|------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Sleep challenges when pregnant (YMYL Health or Safety) | Safe and non-medical tips and tricks for sleeping in the last trimester of pregnancy, provided by people who have personally struggled with this challenge, for example: how to use pillows to sleep comfortably in a position that is safe for babies | Sleep medications that are safe during pregnancy |
| Liver cancer treatment (YMYL Health or Safety) | A sincere and respectful forum discussion where people are describing how they're coping with liver cancer treatment | Different treatment options for liver cancer and the associated life expectancies under each treatment |
| Filling out tax forms (YMYL Financial Security) | A humorous video from a non-expert content creator about the frustration of doing taxes | Instructions on how to fill out tax forms |
| Saving for retirement (YMYL Financial Security) | Reviews of retirement saving services by people with first-hand experience using these services | Advice on how to invest for retirement: how much to save, what kinds of assets to invest in, how much money you will need to retire by a specific age, etc. |
| How to vote (YMYL Society) | A social media post by an ordinary citizen describing why they personally believe it's important to vote in local elections | Information about who is eligible to vote or how to register to vote |


---


## 4.0 Lowest Quality Pages


Lowest quality pages are untrustworthy, deceptive, harmful to people or society, or have other highly undesirable characteristics. The considerations for Lowest quality include quality of the MC, reputation, E-E-A-T, etc., but there are special checks you will need to complete first.


As a reminder, here are the steps for doing PQ rating:
1. Assess the true purpose of the page. If the website or page has a harmful purpose or is designed to deceive people about its true purpose, it should be rated Lowest.
2. Assess the potential of the page to cause harm as described in these guidelines. Websites or pages that are harmful to people or society, untrustworthy, or spammy as specified in these guidelines should receive the Lowest rating.
3. Otherwise, the PQ rating is based on how well the page achieves its purpose using the criteria outlined in these guidelines.


Steps 1 and 2 are a screening process to quickly detect harmful content before other PQ considerations are applied.


To identify Lowest quality pages, start by considering the following:


| Initial Consideration | Lowest Quality Pages |
|-----------------------|----------------------|
| The purpose of the page | The Lowest rating is required if the page has a harmful purpose, or if it is designed to deceive people about its true purpose or who is responsible for the content on the page. |
| The potential for the page to cause harm as described in these guidelines | The Lowest rating is required if the MC is harmful to self or others, harmful to specified groups, or contains harmfully misleading information. |
| The topic of the page, the type of website, and the extent to which YMYL standards apply | A page on any topic or any type of website may qualify for Lowest. Give special scrutiny to pages or websites needing a high level of trust, such as online stores, medical websites, or news coverage of major civic issues. |


Next, assess the page to determine if any of the criteria for Lowest apply:


| Lowest Page Quality Assessment | Justification for Lowest Quality |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Quality of the MC | The page is hacked, defaced, or spammed.<br>The page is gibberish or otherwise makes no sense.<br>The MC is copied, auto-generated, or otherwise created without adequate effort.<br>The MC is created with so little effort, originality, talent, or skill that the page fails to achieve its purpose. |
| The title of the page | The page title is extremely misleading, shocking, or exaggerated. |
| The role of Ads and SC on the page | The MC is deliberately obstructed or obscured due to Ads, SC, interstitial pages, download links, or other content that is beneficial to the website owner but not necessarily the website visitor. |
| Information provided by the website and content creator | A complete lack of information about who is responsible for the website and its content for YMYL pages or other pages requiring trust. |
| Reputation of the website and content creator | A very negative reputation, including a reputation for malicious or harmful behavior. |
| Trustworthiness of the page: E-E-A-T | The page or website is highly untrustworthy.<br>The lack of experience, expertise, authoritativeness, or trust causes the page to fail to achieve its purpose. |
## Types of Lowest Quality Pages


There are many different shapes and forms that Lowest pages can take. To help you keep track, the table below organizes Lowest pages into three broad categories: Harmful, Untrustworthy, and Spammy. These categories can overlap (e.g., pages that contain Harmfully Misleading Information are also Untrustworthy).


| Type of Lowest Page | Description | Reference Section |
|---------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Harmful to Self or Other Individuals | Pages that encourage, depict, incite, or directly cause physical, mental, emotional, or financial harm to self or other individuals. <br>Examples include: - Detailed instructions on how to commit suicide - Detailed, realistic, and serious instructions written with the intent to help someone commit murder | Section 4.2 |
| Harmful to Specified Groups | Pages that promote, condone, or incite violence or hatred against a Specified Group of people (as defined in Section 4.3). <br>Examples include: - Content that encourages violence or ill treatment towards a Specified Group - Content with extremely offensive/dehumanizing stereotypes of a Specified Group | Section 4.3 |
| Harmfully Misleading Information | Pages that misinform people in a way that could cause harm. <br>Examples include: - Clearly inaccurate harmful information that can easily be refuted by straightforward and widely accepted facts - Harmful unsubstantiated theories/claims not grounded in any reasonable facts or evidence | Section 4.4 |
| Untrustworthy Webpages | Pages or websites that are deceptive or have untrustworthy characteristics. <br>Examples include: - Pages or websites with deceptive purpose or design - Pages or websites designed to manipulate people into actions that benefit the website or other organization while causing harm to self, others, or Specified Groups | |
| Spammy Webpages | Pages with characteristics of webspam as defined in the [Google Search Essentials Guidelines](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35769) and/or Section 4.6 of these guidelines. <br>Examples include: - Pages deliberately created with no MC or gibberish MC - Hacked, defaced, or spammed pages | Section 4.5 <br>Section 4.6 |


**Important**: There is a lot of content that many people would find controversial, one-sided, off-putting, or distasteful, yet does not meet the criteria for Lowest as described in these guidelines. Use your judgment to follow the standards outlined throughout Section 4.0 rather than relying on personal opinions.


---


## 4.2 Harmful to Self or Other Individuals


Use the Lowest rating for pages with content that encourages, depicts, incites, or directly causes harm to self or other individuals.


Harm includes physical, mental, emotional, or financial harm to people. Pages should be considered Harmful to Self or Other Individuals if they directly attempt to harm people; encourage behavior that may result in harm; depict extremely violent or gory content without a beneficial/educational purpose; or otherwise are severely traumatic to people who view the page.


Pages do not have to be harmful to all people to be considered Harmful to Self or Other Individuals. Different people have different levels of vulnerability to scams, awareness of potential dangers (e.g., dangerous feats depicted in stunt videos), and tolerance for viewing violent/disturbing content. If there is a reasonable possibility that viewing a particular page would cause harm to those who are most vulnerable, it should be considered harmful.


Pages created with a beneficial purpose that report on, discuss, or inform about harmful actions or events (e.g., fictional entertainment, reputable news, education) should typically not be considered Harmful to Self or Other Individuals. For example, advocacy aimed at drawing attention to harmful, real-world actions or events (such as a webpage describing a protest against domestic violence) would not be considered Harmful to Self or Other Individuals.


Here are some examples of content that is vs. is not considered Harmful to Self or Other Individuals:


| Harmful to Self or Other Individuals | NOT Harmful to Self or Other Individuals |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Incitement of violence towards Other Individuals <br>Serious death threats or realistic-sounding threats <br>Exposing personal information belonging to others with malicious intent to target them or promote harassment towards them (i.e., “doxxing”) <br>How-to information that describes how to commit violent acts in an easy-to-replicate way <br>Advocating for, glorifying, or trivializing violence and atrocities, or to disparage victim(s) of violence/atrocities <br>Depicting or promoting information that facilitates or leads to serious harm to people, or discussions that attempt to justify abuse of people <br>Encouraging unsafe behavior or substantially downplaying the risks of dangerous activities (e.g., consuming household cleaning products) <br>Suicide promotion or pro-anorexia content that encourages people to engage in behavior that can result in hospitalization or death <br>Health-related advice that contradicts well-established expert consensus and could result in serious harm or could prevent someone from undertaking a life-saving treatment | Depictions of violence in an action movie <br>A news story about violent events <br>Educational content that may depict violence or gross imagery <br>An explanation of scams meant to raise awareness about them <br>Portrayals of dangerous activities in a manner that discourages others from attempting the same feat (such as by clearly explaining the risks, describing the expertise and equipment required, etc.) |

## 4.3 Harmful to Specified Groups


Use the Lowest rating for pages that promote, condone, or incite hatred against a Specified Group of people.


For the purposes of Search Quality rating, a Specified Group is a group of people that can be defined on the basis of:


- Age (e.g., older adults)
- Caste (e.g., Dalits)
- Disability (e.g., people who are blind)
- Ethnicity (e.g., Roma)
- Gender Identity and Expression (e.g., transgender people)
- Immigration Status (e.g., student visa holders)
- Nationality (e.g., Italians)
- Race (e.g., Asians)
- Religion (e.g., Christians)
- Sex/Gender (e.g., men)
- Sexual Orientation (e.g., lesbians)
- Veteran Status (e.g., Marines)
- Victims of a major violent event and their kin (e.g., victims of the Holocaust)
- Any other characteristic that is associated with systemic discrimination or marginalization (e.g., refugees, people experiencing homelessness)


The tone of the harmful content must be either serious (i.e., not joking or satirical) or mean-spirited (i.e., with an intent to demean or promote intolerance) to be considered Harmful to Specified Groups. Comedy or artistic expression related to a Specified Group should not be considered harmful unless it is clearly mean-spirited or has other clear harmful impacts.


Criticism of objects, philosophies, and ideas is generally not considered Harmful to Specified Groups. For example, negative criticism of a religious doctrine should not be considered targeted at the Specified Group that follows that religion. Remember that the content must promote, condone, or incite hatred of people to be considered Harmful to Specified Groups.


Educational pages (e.g., definitions, research, academic papers), news stories, or other pages that have a beneficial purpose of informing society should not be considered Harmful to Specified Groups. Similarly, historical documents/videos that aim to capture the beliefs of different eras should not be considered Harmful to Specified Groups.


Here are some examples of content that is vs. is not considered Harmful to Specified Groups:


| Harmful to Specified Groups | NOT Harmful to Specified Groups |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Encourages violence or ill treatment towards a Specified Group <br>Promotes intolerance by demonstrating a staunch unwillingness to allow for the views, beliefs, or behavior of a Specified Group <br>Implies that one Specified Group is superior or inferior to another <br>Contains extremely offensive/dehumanizing stereotypes of a Specified Group. Note that stereotypes can be negative or positive. | A historical documentary of WWII featuring speeches from Nazi leaders <br>A stand-up comedy routine that plays off stereotypes in a way that is not mean-spirited <br>A newspaper article about a hate organization <br>The dictionary definition of a slur <br>A discussion about a particular religious text and its views on women |

## 4.4 Harmfully Misleading Information


Use the Lowest rating for pages that mislead people in ways that can cause harm to people and society.


Misleading pages may have been produced with the intent to misinform people, or the content creator may believe that the inaccurate information they are sharing is true. There is an especially high standard for accuracy on clear YMYL topics or other topics where inaccurate information can cause harm. Be sure to research consequential facts or claims as necessary and to the extent the task time allows.


Pages should be considered to contain Harmfully Misleading Information when they contain at least one of the following:


| Type of Harmfully Misleading Information | Description | Examples |
|------------------------------------------|-------------|----------|
| Harmful and clearly inaccurate information | Content that can be refuted by straightforward and widely accepted facts | False claims that a world leader died <br>False dates for an election |
| Harmful claims that contradict well-established expert consensus | Content that is inconsistent with positions, facts, or findings that are widely agreed upon by authorities in the relevant field | Claims that lemons cure cancer <br>Claims that buying lottery tickets is a guaranteed way to save for retirement |
| Harmful unsubstantiated theories/claims | Content that is not grounded in any reasonable facts or evidence, especially those that could erode confidence in public institutions. This includes unsubstantiated theories that have been thoroughly debunked or are too outlandish to be given credence. | Claims that the 9-11 attacks were planned by the U.S. government <br>Claims that world leaders are lizard people |


**Important**: Harmfully Misleading Information can occur from any websites or content creators - even seemingly "expert", "authoritative" or "official" ones. Any type of page with Harmfully Misleading Information should be rated Lowest, regardless of the source.


However, note that some types of information are subjective, debatable, unverifiable, or inconsequential. For example, pages should not be considered to contain Harmfully Misleading Information if they exclusively contain:


- Non-YMYL content created with a clear entertainment purpose, containing no hard claims of factual accuracy, and are not harmful to people or society. Examples include many types of fiction, satire or parody, astrology, folklore, myths, and urban legends.
- Reviews expressing personal preferences, opinions, or value-based judgments about a product, restaurant, book/movie/TV show, etc.
- Claims or statements that are reasonably debatable when there is not a single established correct answer or truth (e.g., discussions about the relative effectiveness of different healthcare systems)
- Insignificant errors or inaccurate information about a trivial topic (e.g., inaccuracies in the height of a celebrity)


Pages that aim to persuade others that a certain position or perspective is correct are fairly common on the Internet. Pages with one-sided/opinionated/controversial/polarizing content should not be considered to contain Harmfully Misleading Information unless they could create harm to individuals or Specified Groups (as described above) and contain clearly inaccurate information, contradict well-established expert consensus, or are not grounded by reasonable facts/evidence.


A webpage may be considered to have Harmfully Misleading Information based on the MC or on other characteristics of the page or information about the content creator (e.g., the title of an article is harmfully misleading, even if the article on its own is not; a creator blatantly misrepresenting their medical credentials for a video on medical topics).


Harmfully Misleading Information can be especially hard to identify because it may require research from outside sources. Reputable fact-checking websites can't always keep up with the volume of unsubstantiated theories/claims produced by the Internet, and some theories may even claim that debunking information is inaccurate. You should attempt to find high-quality, trustworthy sources to check accuracy and seek out the consensus of experts if you are unsure. Please research theories and claims to the extent the task time allows. If a theory/claim seems wildly improbable and can't be verified by independent trustworthy sources, you should consider it unsubstantiated.

## 4.5 Untrustworthy Webpages or Websites


The Lowest rating should be used for pages or websites you strongly suspect are engaging in deceptive or malicious practices.


Some untrustworthy pages are created to benefit the website or organization rather than helping people. Some untrustworthy pages may even exist to cause harm to people who engage with the page, such as scams or malicious downloads.


Your assessment of untrustworthiness may be based on the content of the page, information about the website, information about the content creator, and the reputation of the website or content creator.


Your assessment may also be based on a lack of critically important information. For example, any website involving financial transactions or sensitive information should have comprehensive information about who is responsible for the site and a way to contact the site if something goes wrong. If some aspect of a page or website makes you suspect deception or maliciousness, please look for information about the site. If you cannot find reputation information to confirm your suspicion, carefully explore the site.


Sometimes a single page on an unknown website in isolation may seem odd but subsequent exploration shows no concern. However, if you see a pattern of what appears to be deception or manipulation or become concerned about your own safety, please use the Lowest rating and leave the website immediately.


Pages with the following characteristics should be considered Untrustworthy:
- Inadequate information about the website or content creator for its purpose
- Lowest E-E-A-T or Lowest reputation
- Deceptive purpose, deceptive page design, or deceptive intent
- Deliberately obstructed or obscured MC
- Characteristics of scams, malicious downloads, or other harmful behavior
- Any webpage or website designed to manipulate people into actions that benefit the website or other organization while causing harm to self, others, or Specified Groups


**Important**: Highly untrustworthy pages should be given the Lowest rating even if you are unable to "prove" the webpage or site is harmful. Because many people are unwilling to use a highly untrustworthy page, an untrustworthy page or website fails to achieve its purpose.


### 4.5.1 Inadequate Information about the Website or Content Creator for the Purpose of the Page


For pages that require a high level of trust, information about who created the content and who is responsible for the content is critical.


As discussed in [Section 2.5.3](#2.5.3-finding-about-us-contact-information-and-customer-service-information), we expect most websites to have some information about who (e.g., what individual, company, business, foundation, etc.) is responsible for the website and who created the MC and some contact information, unless there is a good reason for anonymity. As you will see in the examples below, many types of Lowest pages such as malicious downloads and scams typically have no information or fake information about who is responsible to prevent recourse by people who are harmed.


Any site that handles personal, private, or sensitive data must provide extensive contact information. This includes sites that ask users to create passwords, share personal information, or conduct financial transactions.


YMYL pages or websites that handle sensitive data with absolutely no information about the website or content creator should be rated Lowest.


### 4.5.2 Lowest E-E-A-T and Lowest Reputation of the Website or Content Creator


If the E-E-A-T of a page is low enough, people cannot or should not use the MC of the page. If a page on YMYL topics is highly inexpert, it should be considered Untrustworthy and rated Lowest.


Use the Lowest rating if the website and content creator have an extremely negative reputation, to the extent that many people would consider the webpage or website untrustworthy.


Here are some examples originally shown in [Section 3.3.3](#3.3.3-how-to-search-for-reputation-information-about-a-website). All pages on these websites should be rated Lowest because of the credible extremely negative or malicious reputation of these websites, making them untrustworthy.


**Note**: These website examples may be considered Harmful in some form as well. Sometimes reputation research exposes information that may not meet the criteria for considering a website harmful but does cause it to be untrustworthy.


| Website | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Site selling children’s jungle gym | **Evidence of fraudulent behavior**: There are many reviews on websites describing how users sent money and did not receive anything in return. There is also a news article about this business engaging in financial fraud. |
| Site selling products related to eyewear | **Evidence of criminal behavior**: This website engaged in criminal behavior such as physically threatening users. |
| Organization serving the hospitalized veteran community | **Evidence of fraudulent behavior**: There are many detailed negative articles on news sites and charity watchdog sites describing fraud and financial mishandling about this organization. |


### 4.5.3 Deceptive Page Purpose and Deceptive MC Design


Pages or websites are Untrustworthy if they have a deceptive purpose. These pages or websites superficially appear to have one purpose but in fact exist for a different reason.


All pages with a deceptive purpose and/or deceptive MC should be rated Lowest because pages that engage in deception are Untrustworthy.


The following list includes some common types of deceptive purpose pages. However, no list of deceptive page types will be complete—deceptive websites continue to evolve as people and search engines figure out how they are being tricked.


- A webpage or website that impersonates a different site (e.g., copied logo or branding of an unaffiliated site, URL that mimics another site's name, etc.)
- A non-satirical social network profile made by an impersonator
- A webpage or website that looks like a news source or information page but in fact has articles to manipulate users in order to benefit a person, business, government, or other organization politically, monetarily, or otherwise
- A webpage claims to offer an independent review or share other information about a product but is in fact created to make money for the owner of the website without attempting to help users. For example, the MC may contain intentionally misleading or inaccurate information created with the sole purpose of getting users to click on monetized links or buy the product
- A website claims to be the personal website of a celebrity, but the website is actually created to make money for the owner of the website without the permission of the celebrity. For example, the page may have false testimonials for a product and is created for the sole purpose of getting users to click on monetized links or buy the product
- A webpage with a misleading title or a title that has nothing to do with the content on the page. People who come to the page expecting content related to the title will feel tricked or deceived
- A webpage or website with deceptive website information. For example, the website may misrepresent who owns the site, what the website's purpose really is, how the content was created, how to contact the site, etc.


Another form of deception is through the design of the page. Some pages are deliberately designed to manipulate users to take an action that will benefit the owner of the website rather than help the user.


Here are some common types of pages with deceptive MC design:
- **Pages that disguise Ads as MC**: Actual MC may be minimal or created to encourage users to click on the Ads. For example, fake search pages (example) that have a list of links that look like a page of search results. If you click on a few of the links, you will see that the page is just a collection of Ads disguised as search engine results. A “search box” is present, but submitting a new query just gives you a different page of Ads disguised as search results.
- **Pages that disguise Ads as website navigation links**: For example, fake directory pages (example) that look like a personally curated set of helpful links, possibly with unique descriptions. In reality, the links are Ads or links to other similar pages on the site. Sometimes the descriptions of the links are unrelated to the page.


Take a good look at the page and use your judgment. If you believe the true purpose of the page is not what it appears to be, the page should be rated Lowest. If you believe the page was deliberately created with the primary purpose to manipulate users to click on Ads, monetized links, questionable download links, etc., rather than to help people, the page should be rated Lowest. If the page uses deception in any form even if not described here, the page should be rated Lowest.


### 4.5.4 Deliberately Obstructed or Obscured MC


Pages are untrustworthy if the MC is deliberately obstructed or obscured due to Ads, SC, interstitial pages, download links, or other content that is beneficial to the website owner but not necessarily the website visitor. Attempts to manipulate or coerce users away from the MC is evidence of untrustworthiness.


Here are some examples of pages with deliberately obstructed or obscured MC that should be rated Lowest:
- Ads that continue to cover the MC as the website visitor scrolls down the page. The Ads are virtually impossible to close without clicking on the Ad
- Pop-ups that obscure the MC and cannot be closed without taking an action that benefits the website
- An interstitial page that attempts to coerce a download or click that does not benefit the website visitor
- Ads that push the MC down so far that many users would not notice the MC
- MC in white-on-white text or MC presented so that it is difficult for a human being to read


Logins or paywalls on otherwise trustworthy sites should not be considered untrustworthy, deceptive, or coercive. Many high-quality sites such as newspapers or magazines cannot exist without monetization through subscriptions and paywalls. Some types of MC should be login protected, such as pages with personal information on online banking websites or private pages on social network websites.


MC may be inaccessible for non-deliberate or non-coercive reasons, such as content that doesn't load or content that is unavailable in a country or region. These are not reasons for Lowest.


Use your judgment to assess whether the page is designed to manipulate or coerce users into taking actions that benefit the website. If you are unsure, look at other pages on the same website, conduct reputation research, etc.


**Important**: Remember that many websites need monetization to share content with users. The presence of Ads alone is not enough for Lowest.


### 4.5.5 Suspected Malicious Behavior


It may be difficult to prove that a page causes harm without experiencing harm yourself. For this reason, you may use the Lowest rating if you strongly suspect a page is malicious or harmful even without having proof. Any of the following should be considered untrustworthy:
- Pages or websites that you strongly suspect are scams (see these links for more information about Internet scams: [Avoid Scams 1](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/dashboard/avoid-scams), [Avoid Scams 2](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-avoid-scam), [Internet Fraud](https://www.fbi.gov/scams-and-safety/common-scams-and-crimes/internet-fraud)
- Pages that ask for personal information without a legitimate reason (for example, pages that ask for name, birthdate, address, bank account, government ID number, etc.)
- Pages that appear to “phish” for passwords to Facebook, Gmail, or other popular online services. See [here](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-recognize-and-avoid-phishing-scams) for information about “phishing” fraud.
- Pages with links that you strongly suspect are malware downloads.


**Important**: Do not continue to interact with the page if you observe these characteristics.


If you do click on a link and encounter a malware warning from your browser or antivirus software (example), please do not continue to that page. You can assume that the page is malicious for the purpose of rating and use Lowest.


Note that not all warnings your browser may display are related to malware (e.g., other types of browser warnings include certificate acceptance requests, content filtering warnings, etc.). If you are unsure or hesitant to continue to the page for any reason, you can release the task.


## 4.6 Spammy Webpages


Pages and websites should exist for the benefit of people who visit the website. There are many types of webpages that can benefit visitors, such as online shopping or banking services, videos offering entertainment, or personal pages sharing a perspective or experience. Some of these pages depend on advertising and monetization to maintain the website and create high quality content while still benefiting visitors.


However, some pages are created to benefit the website owner or other organizations and with little to no attention paid to the experience of the people who visit. When such pages use deceptive techniques to appear near the top of search results, it may disincentivize the creation of high quality content by crowding out pages created with effort, originality, talent, or skill that is helpful for visitors.


This section describes characteristics of spam or spam-like pages that should be rated Lowest. The [Google Search Essentials Guideline](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35769) is a good reference for non-website owners to learn more about different spam techniques. If you recognize any of these spam techniques on a page, please use the Lowest rating.


You do not need to develop spam recognition expertise or use special spam identification tools for PQ rating. Please review this section for guidance on what to look for even without having such tools or expertise.


### 4.6.1 Cannot Determine a Purpose, No MC, Little MC, or Lowest Quality MC


All pages should be created with sufficient MC quality so that the page can achieve its purpose. However, some pages are so lacking in MC that the purpose of the page itself is unclear or you may suspect the page is not actually created for people.


If any of the following are true, the page should be rated Lowest:
- Despite your best efforts, the purpose of the page cannot truly be understood because the MC is gibberish or otherwise unusable for people
- The page deliberately has no MC
- The page is deliberately created with so little MC that it fails to achieve any purpose
- The page is deliberately created with such low quality MC that it fails to achieve any purpose


### 4.6.2 Hacked, Defaced, or Spammed Pages


A hacked or defaced website is a site that has been modified without permission from the website owner(s).


Websites can become hacked, defaced, or filled with a large amount of distracting and unhelpful content from bad actors. Bad actors may add unrelated MC or SC or may modify existing MC on webpages to change the purpose of the page. These pages should be rated Lowest because they fail to achieve their original purpose. Responsible website owners should regularly check their websites for suspicious behavior and take steps to protect users.


A common problem on forum pages or in the comments sections of pages is "spammed" comments: posts with unrelated comments that are not intended to help other people, but rather to advertise a product or create a link to a website. Frequently these comments are posted by a “bot” rather than a real person. If a specific page on a website has many unrelated “spammed” comments, the page should be rated Lowest.


### 4.6.3 Auto-generated MC


Creating an abundance of content with little effort or originality with no editing or manual curation is often the defining attribute of spammy websites. One way to do this is to use "auto-generated" content.


It is possible to create many pages or even entire websites by designing a basic template from which hundreds or thousands of pages are created, sometimes using content from freely available sources (such as an RSS feed or API). These pages are created with very little effort and have little to no editing or manual curation. There is little value when pages repackage freely available content with little to no attention to the experience of people visiting the page (see [here](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#automatically-generated-content) for more information on automatically generated content).


It is often easiest to recognize auto-generated content by clicking on multiple pages on a website and observing "templated" content. It may be difficult to recognize auto-generated content from a single page, so be sure to explore the website if you suspect the content is templated.


Pages and websites made up of auto-generated content with no editing or manual curation, and no original content or value added for users, should be rated Lowest.


### 4.6.4 Copied MC with No Added Value


Another way to create an abundance of content with little effort or originality is to copy content from another source. The word “copied” refers to the practice of “scraping” content or copying content from other non-affiliated websites without adding any original content or value to users (see [here](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35681) for more information on copied or scraped content).


Any type of content may be copied: text, images, video, etc. Images may be slightly cropped or edited to avoid detection. People may alter videos as well, or even make a video of a screen playing a video! Copied content with no value added is Lowest quality.


Sometimes content is "embedded" or included on the page from another source. There is nothing wrong with embedding content, but the Lowest rating applies if there is no significant original content or value added on the page.


Likewise, social media posts may be reposted by an unrelated account. There is nothing wrong with reposting content, but the Lowest rating applies if there is no value added in the form of additional content, context, or discussion.


Pages created solely with copied, embedded, or reposted content with little to no editing or manual curation are lacking in effort and originality. As with auto-generated content, these techniques can be used to create many pages or even a whole website. For this reason, it is often easiest to recognize pages created solely with copied, embedded, or reposted content by exploring many pages on the site.


The Lowest rating is appropriate if all or almost all of the MC on the page (including text, images, or videos) is copied, embedded, or reposted with little or no effort, originality, talent, skill, manual curation, or added value for users. Such pages should be rated Lowest, even if the page assigns credit for the content to another source.


All of the following are considered copied content:
- Content copied, reposted, or embedded exactly from an identifiable source. Sometimes an entire page is copied, and sometimes just parts of the page are copied. Sometimes multiple pages are copied and then pasted together into a single page. Content that has been copied, reposted, or embedded exactly is usually the easiest type of copied content to identify.
- Content that is copied, but changed slightly from the original. This type of copying makes it difficult to find the exact matching original source. Sometimes just a few words are changed, or whole sentences are changed, or a "find and replace" modification is made, where one word is replaced with another throughout the text. Images may be cropped, or videos may be segmented into shorter clips. These types of changes are deliberately done to make it difficult to find the original source of the content. We call this kind of content “copied with minimal alteration.”
- Content copied from a changing source, such as a search results page or news feed. You often won't be able to find an exact matching original source if it is a copy of “dynamic” content (content that changes frequently). However, we will still consider this to be copied content.


**Important**: Licensed or syndicated content should not be considered as “copied” (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_syndication) for more on web syndication). Examples of syndicated content in the U.S. include news articles by AP or Reuters.


### 4.6.5 How to Determine if Content is Copied


How do you determine whether all or most of the MC is copied? How do you identify the original source of the content? These things can be difficult to determine, but the following steps may help:


1. Copy a sentence or phrase in the text. 
   - It may be necessary to try a few sentences or phrases from the page just to be sure. 
   - When deciding what sentence or phrase to copy, try to find a sentence or series of several words without punctuation, unusual characters, or suspicious words that may have replaced the original text.
2. Search on Google by pasting the sentence or phrase (surrounded by quotation marks to search for an exact match) inside the Google search box. You may also try without quotation marks to search for more general matches.


Here are some sentences and phrases from this page about “The Wizard of Oz” film and how to search for them:


| Sentence or Phrase From a Sentence | Query to Find the Sentence or Phrase |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| A sentence on the page: <br>All are convinced by Dorothy that the Wizard can help them too | Try the query both with and without quotation marks around the sentence: <br>[ “All are convinced by Dorothy that the Wizard can help them too” ] <br>[ All are convinced by Dorothy that the Wizard can help them too ] |
| A phrase on the page: <br>Dorothy uses the Golden Cap to summon the Winged Monkeys | Try the query both with and without quotation marks around the sentence: <br>[ “Dorothy uses the Golden Cap to summon the Winged Monkeys” ] <br>[ Dorothy uses the Golden Cap to summon the Winged Monkeys ] |
| A different phrase on the page: <br>revealing an old man who had journeyed to Oz from Omaha long ago in a hot air balloon | Try the query both with and without quotation marks around the sentence: <br>[ “revealing an old man who had journeyed to Oz from Omaha long ago in a hot air balloon” ] <br>[ revealing an old man who had journeyed to Oz from Omaha long ago in a hot air balloon ] |


3. Compare the pages you find that match the sentence or phrase:
   - Is most of their MC the same? If so, does one clearly come from a highly authoritative source that is known for original content creation (newspaper, magazine, medical foundation, etc.)? 
   - Does one source seem to reasonably be the original? 
   - Does one source appear to have the earliest publication date, verified by sources like the Wayback Machine?


Use your best judgment. Sometimes it is clear that the content is copied from somewhere, but you cannot tell what the original source is. Other times the content found on the original source has changed enough that searches for sentences or phrases may no longer match the original source. For example, Wikipedia articles can change dramatically over time. Text copied from old copies may not match the current content. If you strongly suspect the page you are evaluating is not the original source, consider it likely to be copied.


Based on this older version of a Wikipedia article about “The Wizard of Oz,” which can be found using the Internet Archive Wayback Machine, we can confirm that the text in the table has been copied. Please note that searching for the above sentence and phrases will not lead you to a current Wikipedia article about “The Wizard of Oz,” which demonstrates how confirming that the MC of a page contains copied content can sometimes be difficult.


**Important**: The Lowest rating is appropriate if all or almost all of the MC on the page is copied with little or no effort, manual curation, or added value for users. Such pages should be rated Lowest, even if the page assigns credit for the content to another source.

# 5.0 Low Quality Pages


Low quality pages do not achieve their purpose well because they are lacking in an important dimension or have a problematic aspect. Low quality pages do not meet the standards for Lowest but may have similar though milder undesirable characteristics.


To identify Low quality pages, start by considering the following:


| Initial Consideration | Low Quality Pages |
|-----------------------|--------------------|
| The purpose of the page | Low quality pages have a beneficial or non-harmful purpose. |
| The potential for the page to cause harm as described in these guidelines | Low quality pages have either no potential to cause harm, or have some mild potential for harm but do not meet the standards for Lowest as described in Section 4.0. |
| The topic of the page, the type of website, and the extent to which YMYL standards apply | A page on any topic or any type of website may qualify for Low. Give special scrutiny to pages or websites needing a high level of trust, such as online stores, medical websites, or news coverage of major civic issues. |


Next, assess the page to determine if any of the criteria for Low apply:


| Low Page Quality Assessment | Any one of the following is justification for Low |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Quality of the MC | MC is created without adequate effort, originality, talent, or skill necessary to achieve the purpose of the page in a satisfying way. |
| The title of the page | The page title is slightly misleading, shocking, or exaggerated. |
| The role of Ads and SC on the page | The Ads or SC significantly distract from or interrupt the use of the MC as described in Section 5.3. |
| Information provided by the website and content creator | Unsatisfying amount of website information or information about the content creator for the purpose of the page. **Important**: For personal content shared on social media platforms or forums, an alias or username is adequate. |
| Reputation of the website and content creator | A mildly negative reputation of the website or content creator. |
| Trustworthiness of the page: E-E-A-T | Inadequate level of E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page. **Important**: Low quality pages can occur on any type of website, including academic websites, nonprofit websites, government websites, or any other generally helpful type of website. Low quality pages may be about any topic. Pages on YMYL topics need more scrutiny for signs of Low quality related to the MC and website/content creator because the page could impact a person’s health, financial stability, or safety, or the welfare or well-being of society. However, for any type of page, a single Low quality attribute is enough to use the Low quality rating. |


---


## 5.1 Lacking E-E-A-T


Low quality pages often lack an appropriate level of E-E-A-T for the topic or purpose of the page. Here are some examples:
- The content creator lacks adequate experience, e.g., a restaurant review written by someone who has never eaten at the restaurant
- The content creator lacks adequate expertise, e.g., an article about how to skydive written by someone with no expertise in the subject
- The website or content creator is not an authoritative or trustworthy source for the topic of the page, e.g., tax form downloads provided on a cooking website
- The page or website is not trustworthy for its purpose, e.g., a shopping page with minimal customer service information


**Important**: The Low rating should be used if the page lacks appropriate E-E-A-T for its purpose. No other considerations such as positive reputation or the type of website can overcome a lack of E-E-A-T for the topic or purpose of the page.


## 5.2 Low Quality Main Content


MC is Low quality if it is created without adequate effort, originality, talent, or skill necessary to achieve the purpose of the page in a satisfying way. Mild inaccuracies on informational pages are evidence of Low quality. However, if the page has harmful inaccuracies or so many inaccuracies that it feels untrustworthy, the Lowest rating is justified.


There are many possible ways for MC to be Low quality, and Low effort is important to recognize in all forms.


While you may not have experience creating MC on webpages, think about your experience with something similar: writing reports for school. Here are some common shortcuts that students often take to save effort when writing a report:
- Producing content quickly with little attention to important aspects such as clarity or organization
- Saving time by summarizing or paraphrasing from other readily available sources
- Filling a report with large pictures or other distracting content rather than clear, helpful information on the topic
- Using images from other sources (magazines, stock image websites, etc.) to avoid having to create pictures or diagrams to support the material in the report
- Using commonly known facts that require little research, for example: “Argentina is a country. People live in Argentina. Argentina has borders.”
- Using "filler" content, for example: "Pandas eat bamboo. Pandas eat a lot of bamboo. Bamboo is the best food for a Panda bear."


Of course, webpages are more diverse than school reports, but you will recognize some of these same techniques on pages you encounter. Some Low quality content is created with little effort in order to have content to support monetization rather than creating original or effortful content to help users. "Filler" content may also be added, especially at the top of the page, forcing users to scroll down to reach the MC.


Here are some examples of pages with Low quality MC:


| Low Quality MC Examples | Why the MC is considered Low quality |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| A crafting tutorial page with instructions on how to make a basic craft and lots of unhelpful "filler" at the top, such as commonly known facts about the supplies needed or other non-crafting information. | Lacks adequate effort to clearly present the instructions to people hoping to make the craft. |
| A list of the best vacuum cleaners with product images and reviews that are paraphrased or summarized from other sources, with minimal signs of effort or original content added by the content creator. | Lacks adequate effort and first-hand experience from the content creator. |
| A slide show of the top 10 world destinations using other people's pictures and existing top 10 lists. | Lacks effort and originality. |
| A page titled "How many centimeters are in a meter?" with a large amount of off-topic and unhelpful content such that the very small amount of helpful information is hard to find. | Lacks effort, has excessive filler, lacks depth, and has only commonly known facts. |
| A list of the tallest mountains in the world that is missing Mount Everest. | Lacks accuracy and effort. |


The title of the page is also considered part of the MC. Titles are important because they represent the page in search results and help users decide what to click on. A misleading title can lead to a poor search experience. Exaggerated or shocking titles are evidence of Low quality because of the poor user experience that results when users see the actual MC after reaching the page.


Here are some examples of pages with Low quality titles:


| Low Quality Title Examples | Why the Title is considered Low quality |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| A page titled "Pink Elephant: Part 2 coming soon!", but includes only speculation and rumor about a potential movie sequel that may or may not be produced. | Slightly misleading title would give people the impression that the movie sequel has a confirmed release date, and that the page would provide accurate information about it. |
| A page titled "Is the World about to End? Mysterious Sightings of Sea Serpents Prompt Panic!", for an article about the remains of a dead fish on a beach. | Exaggerated and shocking title is a mismatch with the content of the article. |
| A page titled "Eat the Healthiest Foods in the WORLD to extend your life!!!!" for a list of tips on how to add more fruits and vegetables to meals. | Overly exaggerated title suggests that the page would offer something more than the basic nutrition advice it provides. |


The level of talent or skill required for artistic expression by ordinary people on social media or other websites that allow content sharing should be viewed leniently. In many cases, people post activities to share with friends, such as a video documenting a first attempt at a new hobby. These types of pages should not be considered Low on the basis of talent or skill because the primary purpose is sharing content. Use the Low rating only if the lack of talent or skill prevents the page from achieving its purpose well.


**Important**: Low quality MC does not meet the standard for Lowest and is not harmful, but it is unsatisfying for the purpose of the page or causes the page to fail to achieve its purpose well.


## 5.3 Distracting Ads/SC


We expect Ads and SC to be visible. However, some Ads, SC, or interstitial pages (i.e., pages displayed before or after the content you are expecting) make it difficult to use the MC. Pages with Ads, SC, or other features that significantly distract from or interrupt the use of the MC should be given a Low rating.


A single pop-over Ad or interstitial page with a clear and easy-to-use close button is not terribly distracting, even though it may annoy some people. However, difficult-to-close Ads that follow page scrolls, or interstitial pages that require an app download, can be truly distracting and make the MC difficult to use.


The content of the Ads, SC, or other features may be distracting as well: sexually suggestive images such as here, grotesque images such as here, and sexually suggestive Ads on otherwise non-sexual pages are very distracting.


Finally, Ads and SC can be distracting if the titles or images of the Ads or SC are shocking or disturbing. Here is an example of a page with shocking and exaggerated titles, images, and text in the Ads and SC.


**Important**: The Low rating should be used if the page has Ads, SC, or other features that significantly distract from or interrupt the use of the MC.


## 5.4 Mildly Negative Reputation of the Website or Content Creator


The Low rating should be used if the website or the content creator has a mildly negative reputation.


If the MC was created by a content creator who is using the website to host it, research the reputation of the content creator. Expect to find reputation information on well-known journalists, authors, social media influencers, bloggers and vloggers, professionals such as lawyers and doctors, etc. Pay attention when there is evidence of a mildly negative—though not malicious or financially fraudulent—reputation. However, a lack of reputation information for ordinary people and lesser-known content creators is expected and is not a sign of Low quality.


Exercise care when researching the reputation of businesses. Try to find enough reviews to understand a range of customer opinions and experiences, and read the details of negative reviews and low ratings before inferring that the business overall has a negative reputation. A few negative customer service reviews are typical for businesses such as stores or restaurants.


## 5.5 Unsatisfying Amount of Information about the Website or Content Creator


Expect to find some form of website information for many or most websites. We expect clear information about who (e.g., what individual, company, business, foundation, etc.) created the MC, unless there is good reason for anonymity. A long-standing Internet alias or username can identify the content creator. For personal websites or forum discussions on non-YMYL topics, an email address or social media link alone may be sufficient. Many people are reasonably hesitant to share personally identifiable information online!


Stores and websites that process financial transactions require a high level of user trust. If a store or financial transaction website has just an email address and physical address, it may be difficult to get help if there are issues with the transaction. Likewise, many other types of websites on clear YMYL topics also require a high level of user trust.


**Important**: Pages that offer payment functionality or process other types of financial transactions should receive a Low rating if there is an unsatisfying amount of customer service information or contact information. Pages on YMYL topics and other pages that require a high level of user trust should receive a Low rating if there is an unsatisfying amount of information about who is responsible for the website or who created the content. For forums, social media pages, and other websites where people commonly exchange opinions, a username is an acceptable identifier.


## 5.6 Examples of Low Quality Pages


| Type of Webpage/Content | Low Quality Justification | PQ Rating and Explanation |
|-------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| Low: News 1 | Article about nuclear power | **Unsatisfying MC for the purpose of the page**: does not achieve the purpose well <br>MC lacks accuracy or does not align with well-established expert consensus <br>Low E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page<br>**Information about energy sources and nuclear power could significantly impact global industries and society. This is a YMYL topic.**<br>The writing of this article is unprofessional, including many grammar and punctuation errors. The MC also appears to have been paraphrased from a [science article](https://example.com) found on a different source, but with factual inaccuracies introduced throughout. The combination of low-quality MC and lack of E-A-T justifies the Lowest+ to Low rating.
| Low: News 2 | Article titled "Getting Rid of Toxins After The Holiday Season" | **Unsatisfying MC for the purpose of the page**: does not achieve the purpose well <br>MC lacks accuracy or does not align with well-established expert consensus <br>Slightly misleading, shocking, or exaggerated title <br>Low E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page<br>**The title of the article is misleading and does not reflect the actual content of the page. The MC does not explain how to get rid of toxins or what the word "toxins" in the headline refers to.**<br>The content also has many problems: the writing quality is poor, and the article includes meaningless statements such as "water therapy is one of the easiest ways of beauty regimen since it will give enough moisture on the skin". The article fails to cite sources, and there is no evidence of E-A-T.
| Low: Informational | 40th birthday party food ideas | **Unsatisfying MC for the purpose of the page**: does not achieve the purpose well <br>Ads or SC significantly distract from or interrupt the use of MC <br>Low E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page<br>**This page and website have many characteristics of Low-quality pages.**<br>Close observation shows MC that contains mostly commonly known information and poor-quality writing, demonstrating a lack of effort. The MC is broken up by large Ads that significantly disrupt the user experience.
| Low: Article 1 | Article with tips for dressing for the office | **Unsatisfying MC for the purpose of the page**: does not achieve the purpose well <br>Low E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page<br>**This informational article has multiple Low-quality characteristics leading to a Low or Lowest+ rating.**<br>There is a large amount of "filler" or meaningless content and a complete lack of effort in editing. In addition, the MC contains only commonly known information with no expertise or first-hand experience shared by the content creator.
| Low: Article 2 | Using ginger for your health | **Unsatisfying MC for the purpose of the page**: does not achieve the purpose well <br>MC lacks accuracy or does not align with well-established expert consensus <br>Low E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page<br>**This informational article has multiple Low-quality characteristics leading to a Low or Lowest+ rating.**<br>There is garbled or meaningless content, a complete lack of effort in editing, and unrelated links in the middle of the page. Additionally, the article is on a health topic, and there are no signs that the content creator has relevant expertise or links to support the medical claims made in the article.
| Low: Article 3 | How to adopt children from Iraq | **Unsatisfying MC for the purpose of the page**: does not achieve the purpose well <br>Low E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page<br>**Adopting a child significantly impacts the health and well-being of families. This is a YMYL topic.**<br>However, the steps listed here are merely commonly-known information that would be of little benefit to someone interested in adopting a child from Iraq. For example, step 1 says “Choose an adoption agency” and suggests looking in a phone book. This demonstrates a lack of effort in the creation of MC. There is almost no information specific to Iraq. There is no evidence of expertise on adoption from the description about the author. Note that some Ads have the same format as links to other articles on this website, potentially making it a bit harder for users to visually distinguish these Ads from the MC and SC.
| Low: Financial | Page with advice on picking a quality stock for investment | **Low E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page**<br>**Advice on stock investment could significantly impact a person’s financial decisions and security. This is a YMYL topic.**<br>The MC is superficial and includes mostly commonly known information for this topic, e.g., "look at key statistics" or "find companies with rising revenue". There is no evidence that the author has financial expertise. Because this article gives advice on a YMYL financial topic, lacking expertise is a reason for a Low rating.
| Low: Medical | Page with information about how long the flu lasts | **Low E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page**<br>**Many patient hospitalizations and deaths occur due to the flu each year. This topic could significantly impact a person’s health. This is a YMYL topic.**<br>There is no evidence that the author has medical expertise. Because this article gives advice on a YMYL medical topic, lacking expertise is a reason for a Low rating.
| Low: Recipe 1 | Apple pie recipe | **Unsatisfying MC for the purpose of the page**: does not achieve the purpose well<br>**This page and website have many characteristics of Low-quality pages.**<br>The MC is low quality and lacks important information. For example, it gives no indication of how to make a crust and doesn’t list premade crust as an ingredient. It would be very difficult to actually make an apple pie using this recipe. This page is lacking the kind of helpful content we expect in recipe pages, such as user reviews or comments. Without such information, it’s hard to tell if the recipe is any good. The small pink text at the top is not helpful for users.
| Low: Recipe 2 | Gluten-free New York cheesecake recipe | **Ads or SC significantly distract from or interrupt the use of MC**<br>**This is an example of distracting and disruptive Ads/SC**: there are large Ads in the main column pushing down the MC as well as highly distracting content on the right that are labeled “Top Posts & Pages.” It is unclear whether these are SC or Ads. Additionally, the images in the Ads/SC are shocking, racy, and completely unrelated to the MC, which creates a poor user experience.

# 6.0 Medium Quality Pages


Medium pages have a beneficial purpose and achieve their purpose. There is nothing wrong with Medium quality pages. Expect to encounter many Medium quality pages in PQ rating tasks.


To identify Medium quality pages, start by considering the following:


| Initial Consideration | Medium Quality Pages |
|-----------------------|----------------------|
| The purpose of the page | Medium quality pages have a beneficial or non-harmful purpose. |
| The potential for the page to cause harm as described in these guidelines | Medium quality pages are not expected to cause harm. |
| The topic of the page, the type of website, and the extent to which YMYL standards apply | A page on any topic or any type of website may qualify for Medium. Give special scrutiny to pages on YMYL topics or websites needing a high level of trust, such as online stores. |
| The title of the page | Medium quality pages have titles that summarize the page. |
| The role of Ads and SC on the page | Ads and SC do not block or significantly interfere with the MC on Medium quality pages. |
| Information provided by the website and content creator | Medium quality pages have adequate information about the website and content creator for the purpose of the page. For stores or websites that process financial transactions, examine the customer service information. |


**Remember**: Many websites need monetization to share content with users. The presence or absence of Ads alone is not a consideration for PQ rating.


**Important**: For personal content shared on social media platforms or forums, an alias or username is adequate.


Next, assess the page to determine if the criteria for Medium apply:


| Medium Page Quality Assessment | Medium Quality Criteria |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Quality of the MC | MC created with adequate effort, originality, talent, or skill such that the page achieves its purpose. |
| Reputation of the website and content creator | Not especially positive nor especially negative: Reputation information found about the website or content creator is not concerning, but not positive enough to justify a higher rating. |
| Trustworthiness of the page: E-E-A-T | Adequate level of E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page. |


---


## 6.1 Types of Medium Quality Pages


There are two types of Medium quality pages:


| Type of Medium Page | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Nothing wrong, but nothing special | All of the Medium Page Quality considerations and criteria apply. |
| Mixed, but with some redeeming qualities | The page or website has some signs of High quality (E-E-A-T, quality of the MC, positive reputation), but also has one sign or mild signs of Low quality. |


**Important**: For a page to receive a rating higher than Medium, it must meet the criteria described in the next sections on High and Highest page quality. For a page to receive a rating lower than Medium, it must meet the criteria for Low or Lowest page quality. Medium is a rating that applies to many pages you will encounter in PQ rating tasks: many pages have nothing wrong, yet do not represent the high or highest quality content that's available online.

# 7.0 High Quality Pages


High quality pages serve a beneficial purpose and achieve that purpose well. High quality pages exist for almost any beneficial purpose you can imagine, from providing information to selling products to making people laugh to artistic expression.

| Trustworthiness of the page: E-E-A-T | High level of E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page. |

## 7.1 High Quality Main Content


High quality MC should be satisfying for people visiting the page. High quality MC shows evidence of effort, originality, talent, or skill. For informational pages, High quality MC must be accurate and consistent with well-established expert consensus when such consensus exists. Have high standards! If you aren't sure whether the content is high quality, try finding other pages on the same topic to help calibrate your assessment: "typical" and "average" pages on a topic generally have Medium (not High) quality MC.


To help develop your standards, here are some examples of High quality MC in contrast with Low quality MC:


| High Quality MC | Low Quality MC |
|------------------|----------------|
| **High level of effort**: The website or content creators worked hard to create content that achieves the purpose of the page. The MC is well-organized, edited, and curated to support the purpose. <br>Examples: <br>- A news article with accuracy, depth, and clarity <br>- A Q&A page or forum post with meaningful discussion by multiple participants <br>- A well-organized crafting tutorial page with clear, helpful instructions so that others can make the craft successfully | **Low level of effort**: The MC shows signs of a lack of effort by the website or content creators. <br>Examples: <br>- Lack of curation or editing: Content that helps the page achieve its purpose is mixed with less helpful distracting or filler content <br>- Lack of content creation: A forum post with little discussion or only superficial comments <br>- Lack of organization: A crafting tutorial page with lots of unhelpful "filler" at the top and little effort put into explaining how to make the craft (the purpose of the page) at the bottom |
| **High originality**: The MC is unique or original to the website. Original photos or video footage produced by the website or content creator. The content on the page is unique to the content creators, such as a personal perspective based on first-hand life experience. | **Low originality**: Information is summarized from other sources with little added value. Photos or videos come from other sources. A summary of the perspectives of others, such as summarizing product reviews written by others. |
| **High level of talent or skill**: The MC showcases the talent of the creator, e.g., a video of a talented content creator dancing. The MC allows the page to achieve its purpose well because the content creator has talent or skill, e.g., a how-to article on plumbing by a skilled plumber. | **Low level of talent or skill**: A lack of adequate talent or skill prevents the page from achieving its purpose, e.g., a how-to article on plumbing by someone who does not have the necessary skill to explain the steps accurately. |

Positive reputation of the website can be a reason for a High rating if the website is responsible for the MC. If the website is not responsible for the MC (e.g., posts on social media websites or forums), positive reputation of the content creator(s) can be a reason for the High rating.


For non-YMYL topics, reputation information may be less formal. Popularity, user engagement, and user reviews can be considered evidence of reputation for non-YMYL websites: websites can be considered to have a positive reputation if they are popular and well-known for their topic or content type.


**Remember**: Many smaller websites and ordinary people have little reputation information available. A page can still receive a High rating without reputation information.


## 7.3 High Level of E-E-A-T


Depending on the purpose of the page, topic, and type of website, a high level of E-E-A-T may be required for the page to achieve its purpose well and be considered High quality. Pages with High E-E-A-T are trustworthy or very trustworthy.


- **Experience** is valuable for almost any topic. Social media posts and forum discussions are often High quality when they involve people sharing their experience. From writing symphonies to reviewing home appliances, first-hand experience can make a social media post or discussion page High quality.


- **Expertise** is required for satisfying content on a variety of topics, from hobbies such as photography to YMYL topics such as tax preparation. Think about the topic of the page and what expertise is needed to create satisfying, trustworthy content. There are many types of informal expertise that may be visible in the MC itself.


- **Authoritativeness** pages of all types can be found. Government tax websites are an authoritative source for tax forms. Local businesses and organizations may be go-to sources for local information. When looking at a page or website, consider whether it is considered a go-to, authoritative source for the type of information it is displaying.


- **Trust** is especially important for High quality pages that involve processing financial transactions or cover YMYL topics. Even if the topic is not YMYL, trust may still be required; for example, product reviews and pages offering advice require at least some level of trust. While not all pages require a high level of trust, a trustworthy page is often a satisfying one.


Think about the topic of the page. What kind of E-E-A-T is required for the page to achieve its purpose well?

## 8.0 Highest Quality Pages


Highest quality pages serve a beneficial purpose and achieve that purpose very well. The distinction between High and Highest is based on the quality of MC, the reputation of the website and content creator, and/or E-E-A-T.


To identify Highest quality pages, start by considering the following:


| Initial Consideration | Highest Quality Pages |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| The purpose of the page | Highest quality pages have a beneficial purpose. |
| The potential for the page to cause harm as described in these guidelines | Highest quality pages are not expected to cause harm. |
| The topic of the page, the type of website, and the extent to which YMYL standards apply | A page on any topic or any type of website may qualify for Highest. Give special scrutiny to pages on YMYL topics or websites needing a high level of trust, such as online stores. |
| The title of the page | Highest quality pages have titles that summarize the page. |
| The role of Ads and SC on the page | Ads and SC do not block or significantly interfere with the MC on Highest quality pages. |
| Information provided by the website and content creator | Highest quality pages have adequate information about the website and content creator for the purpose of the page. For stores or websites that process financial transactions, examine the customer service information. |


**Remember**: Many websites need monetization to share content with users. The presence or absence of Ads alone is not a consideration for PQ rating.


**Important**: For personal content shared on social media platforms or forums, an alias or username is adequate.


Next, assess the page to determine if the criteria for Highest apply:


| Highest Page Quality Assessment | Highest Quality Criteria |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Quality of the MC | MC created with a very high level of effort, originality, talent, or skill such that the page achieves its purpose very well. |
| Reputation of the website and content creator | Very positive reputation of the website for the topic of the page. <br>Very positive reputation of the content creator for the topic of the MC. |
| Trustworthiness of the page: E-E-A-T | Very high level of E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page. |

## 8.1 Very High Quality MC


Very high quality MC should be highly satisfying for people visiting the page. Very high quality MC shows evidence of a high level of effort, originality, talent, or skill. For informational pages, very high quality MC must be accurate, clearly communicated, and consistent with well-established expert consensus when it exists. Very high quality MC represents some of the most outstanding content on a topic or type that's available online.


The standards for Highest quality MC may be very different depending on the purpose, topic, and type of website. Here are some examples of Highest quality original content:


- **For news**: Original reporting that provides information that would not otherwise have been known had the article not revealed it. Accurate, original, in-depth, and investigative reporting requires a high level of skill/talent and effort. Very high quality news content will include a description of primary sources and other original reporting referenced during the content creation process. Very high quality news content must be accurate and should meet professional journalistic standards.


- **For artistic content** (videos, images, photography, writing, etc.): Unique and original content created by highly skilled and talented artists or content creators. Such artistic content requires a high level of skill/talent and effort. If the artistic content is related to a YMYL topic (e.g., artistic content with the purpose of informing or swaying opinion about YMYL topics), YMYL standards should apply.


- **For informational content**: Original, accurate, comprehensive, clearly communicated, and should reflect expert consensus as appropriate. Expectations for different types of information may vary. For example, scientific papers have a different set of expectations than a social media post sharing information about a hobby such as stamp collecting. However, all types of very high quality informational content share common characteristics of accuracy and clarity of communication, in addition to meeting standards appropriate to the topic or field.


The Highest rating may be justified for pages with very satisfying MC created with a very high level of effort, originality, talent, or skill.


## 8.2 Very Positive Reputation


Reputation research is important when giving Highest ratings. For YMYL topics, very positive reputation is often based on recommendations from known experts or professional societies appropriate to the topic of the page. Prestigious awards may be evidence as well, depending on the topic and type of content.


For non-YMYL topics, reputation information may be less formal. Popularity, user engagement, and user reviews can be considered evidence of reputation for non-YMYL websites: websites and content creators can be considered to have a very positive reputation if they are seen as one of the best sources available online for a topic or type of content.


**Remember**: Many smaller websites and ordinary people have little reputation information. A page can still receive a Highest rating without reputation information.


## 8.3 Very High Level of E-E-A-T


Very high E-E-A-T is a distinguishing factor for Highest quality pages. A website or content creator who is the uniquely authoritative, go-to source for a topic has very high E-E-A-T. A content creator with a wealth of experience may be considered to have very high E-E-A-T for topics where experience is the primary factor in trust. A very high level of expertise can justify a very high E-E-A-T assessment. Very high E-E-A-T websites and content creators are the most trusted sources on the internet for a particular topic.


Think about what E-E-A-T means for the topic of the page. How important is first-hand experience? Who are the experts? What makes a source highly authoritative for the topic? What makes a website or content creator trustworthy for the topic? Standards for very high E-E-A-T will differ depending on the topic of the page.

## 9.0 Page Quality Criteria for Specific Types of Pages


### 9.1 Ratings for Encyclopedia Pages


There are many encyclopedia-type websites. Some are highly-respected publications that are standard references, while some are websites with content created and edited by anonymous users, with no editorial oversight or fact-checking. We may not always know the author of the specific encyclopedia article, and therefore must rely on website reputation research to determine the E-E-A-T of the article. High and Highest quality ratings should only be used for encyclopedias with very good reputations for accuracy and expertise, where the article itself is well-researched with appropriate references cited.


A note about Wikipedia: in general, the website has a good reputation and is a very popular resource that is generally valued for accuracy. However, there is no single author or organization that vouches for the accuracy of Wikipedia articles, and the quality of pages varies. You should check individual articles to evaluate the quality of the MC.


A Wikipedia article on a non-YMYL topic (example) with a satisfying amount of accurate information and trustworthy external references can usually be rated in the High range. A PQ rating in the Medium range is often appropriate for pages with less extensive MC and external references. Naturally, Wikipedia articles with very little MC should get lower PQ ratings. Factual inaccuracy is a sufficient reason for a Low or Lowest rating.


## 9.3 Ratings for Forums and Q&A Pages


Ratings for forum and Q&A pages can be challenging. Here is some guidance on how to approach these pages:


- The Main Content includes the question, the answers/responses, and the resulting discussions.
- Rate from the point of view of a user who visits the page, rather than a participant involved in the discussion.
- Users who post answers/responses or comments are often identified only by a username or alias. A page can be High or Highest quality with just usernames or aliases depending on other criteria.
- The E-E-A-T of a discussion among users can often be judged by the posts or comments themselves.
  - For some topics, Experience is the most important dimension of Trust. For other topics, assessing Expertise through the posts may be important. In some cases, the posters themselves will highlight either their own Experience or Expertise, or other people will comment on it.
- Pages on YMYL topics require more attention to Trust and more care in the assessment of E-E-A-T.
- Highest quality forum/Q&A pages have extremely satisfying conversations, including participation from users who have put a great deal of effort into their posts and have a wealth of Experience and/or Expertise on the topic. Such conversations can be very satisfying because of the depth of discussion, the unique insights, or the sharing of experiences that many would not have access to in their real-world community.
- Low quality forum/Q&A pages often lack effort (few responses, surface-level rather than in-depth discussion), lack Experience or Expertise, contain mild inaccuracies, or show a significant lack of respect or decorum among the participants that might deter others from joining the discussion.
- Lowest quality forum/Q&A pages may contain information or advice that is harmfully misleading, contradicts well-established expert consensus, encourages harm towards self or other individuals/participants, etc.
- One challenge is rating pages with little to no participation, and/or no answer to an open question:
  - A new page or recently started discussion that consists only of a question or initial post by a person should generally be rated Medium unless there are other low quality attributes. These pages may need time to achieve their purpose.
  - Over time, no participation in a discussion (or only superficial discussion) and/or no meaningful answer to an open question may be a reason for a Low quality rating, especially in the presence of other low quality attributes.
- Another challenge occurs when the discussion on the page drifts, becomes combative, or becomes dominated by misleading or spammy content. When rating, value the insightful, meaningful discussion that exists. If the page is a mix of high and low quality characteristics but has insightful, meaningful discussion, the Medium rating may be most appropriate as long as the page is not potentially harmful.


Here are some examples:


| Webpage/Type of Content | Characteristics of the Page | PQ Rating and Explanation |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Lowest: Q&A page about chest pains and smoking | - Harmfully Misleading Information: Contains inaccurate and potentially dangerous medical advice about a YMYL topic | **Information about chest pain and smoking could significantly impact people’s decisions to seek medical treatment. This page is on a YMYL topic.** <br> This page must be evaluated from the point of view of a user visiting this page from a search engine, rather than a participant. The question is poorly worded and difficult to understand. <br> There aren't many responses. One response correctly warns about the danger of smoking cigarettes but suggests smoking marijuana instead. Another response suggests that it's fine to keep smoking and that aspirin can be used to address pain. The last response lacks respect: it asks if the person who asked the original question is stupid. <br> The answers have incorrect and potentially dangerous medical advice, making it lowest quality MC.
| Low: Q&A page about a 2002 Volvo part | - Unsatisfying MC for the purpose of the page: does not achieve the purpose well <br> - Misleading page design |
| Medium: Forum page with a new question, posted by a person | - Nothing wrong, nothing special <br> - Real in-depth question, posted very recently <br> - No one has responded (yet) | **Forums rely on user engagement to create satisfying MC. In this case, a real person has posted a question that can lead to good discussion. The question is only hours old (at the time this example was created).** <br> For new questions, discussions and threads, a Medium rating is appropriate if there are no low quality characteristics but also no opportunity for discussion yet.
| Medium: Forum page on an online auction website | - Mixed, but with some redeeming qualities: <br> - High E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page <br> - Unsatisfying MC for the purpose of the page: does not achieve the purpose well |
| Medium: Forum page on how to wash ballet shoes | - Mixed, but with some redeeming qualities: <br> - Adequate MC: achieves the purpose of the page <br> - Ads or SC significantly distract from or interrupt the use of MC <br> - High E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page | **This forum is about dance topics, and many pages have expertise from a community of ballet dancers. On this particular page, participants have first-hand experience washing ballet shoes and make recommendations based on their own experiences.** <br> This page is “mixed” because there is some distracting content that makes it hard to read the MC. However, this is not a beauty contest! Even though the page may be cluttered, there is some valuable E-E-A-T and helpful MC, making Medium a good rating for this page.
| High: Forum post on the magic loop technique in knitting | - MC is satisfying for the purpose of the page: demonstrates effort, originality, talent, or skill <br> - High E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page | **The person who posted the first message on this forum page provides a helpful resource on how to master the magic loop technique in knitting (effort, skill). She also shares pictures of her own version using an old pair of blue jeans (original content). With over 20 years of experience knitting socks, we would consider her to be an expert on the topic.**
| High: Q&A page about whether a Roomba will work | - Satisfying MC: achieves the purpose of the page well <br> - High E-E-A-T for the purpose of the page | **Many participants share their personal experiences with these products, giving details such as how well certain models work with pet hair (effort, first-hand experience, original content). There are many descriptions of participants’ own experiences with this product and how well it works for them, making the MC satisfying for the purpose of the page.**

## 10.0 Page Quality Rating Tasks


At first, PQ rating may seem difficult. There are several aspects of the page and the website to look at and think about.


**Important**: Do not struggle with each PQ rating. Please give your best rating and move on. If you are having trouble deciding between two ratings, use the lower rating. If you are torn between three ratings, choose the one in the middle.


Do not consider the country or location of the page or website for PQ rating. For example, English (US) raters should use the same PQ standards when rating pages from other English language websites (UK websites, Canadian websites, etc.) as they use when rating pages from U.S. websites. In other words, English (US) raters should not lower the PQ rating because the page location (UK, Canada) does not match the task location.


These guidelines are specific to "regular" webpages. Occasionally, you may be asked to rate a landing page that is not a webpage. For example, you may be asked to rate a PDF file, a PNG or JPEG image file, etc. When the landing page of the URL is not a webpage, some of the criteria in these guidelines may not apply. In this case, please use your judgment.


Finally, this Page Quality Rating Guideline does not completely cover every aspect of page quality. If you find pages that you truly believe to be High or Low quality, please rate them as such, even if the reason is based on something not covered in these guidelines. Please use the comment section to explain your reasoning. As always, use your judgment.


### 10.1 Instructions for Rating Page Quality Tasks


The Page Quality task page is broken up into several parts:
1. Some initial questions about the task landing page.
2. A “PQ grid” to record your observations about PQ characteristics of the landing page.
3. The Overall PQ rating slider which records your Overall PQ rating.
4. A comment box to explain your rating.


Some results to the initial questions will end the task early. If the page is Porn, Foreign Language, Did Not Load, or consists of restricted or inaccessible MC (e.g., subscription is required to view MC), you will not fill in the PQ grid or assign an overall rating.


- **Foreign Language** should not be used when the language on the landing page is in the task language, a language that is commonly used by a significant percentage of the population in the task location, or English.
- **Did Not Load** should be used for pages where there is absolutely no content on the page created by the website. There is no MC, SC, or Ads on the page. See this Wikipedia article for descriptions of different types of error messages.


The PQ grid is designed to be your "note pad." It allows you to record your observations about the landing page and the website it belongs to.

## 11.0 Page Quality Rating FAQs


| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Why do we have to do all these steps? This takes a long time! | With practice, the amount of time needed for accurate PQ ratings will decrease. The steps are important and are designed to help you assess many different aspects of PQ. You may be surprised by what you find. Pages that initially look Low quality may turn out to be Medium or High quality with careful inspection. The reverse may happen as well. We want your most informed, thoughtful opinion. |
| Are we just giving High quality ratings to pages that “look” good? | No! The goal is to do the exact opposite. These steps are designed to help you analyze the page without using a superficial “does it look good?” approach. |
| Is sharing a personal experience or opinion a beneficial purpose? What if the personal opinion is upsetting or offensive? | Sharing a personal experience or opinion can be a beneficial purpose as it allows people to appreciate different perspectives. Content on the Internet can help people understand why others think and feel the way they do. It can be valuable to see the opinions and perspectives of others, even when they are off-putting, distasteful, upsetting, or offensive to you personally. Apply the standards of these guidelines rather than your own personal opinions or views. However, sometimes opinions and perspectives can spread misleading information or otherwise have the potential to cause harm. Therefore, apply the standards in these guidelines to all types of pages and content. **Remember**: Your assessment of harm happens before and overrides other considerations such as the life experience or expertise of the content creator. |
| Can life experience justify a Highest quality rating for a page on a YMYL topic? | Factual information and advice on YMYL topics should come from experts. Sharing life experience on YMYL topics can be Highest quality, but it must be trustworthy, safe, consistent with well-established expert consensus, and speak to topics that life experience is valuable for. For example, information about when and where to vote is a YMYL topic. It's possible to have a Highest quality page that shares life experience about voting, such as an inspiring personal post about becoming a citizen and voting for the first time. However, if a page about someone's voting experience gives inaccurate information about when and where to vote either deliberately or through careless oversight, the page should be rated Lowest because it could cause others to miss the opportunity to vote. |
| You talked about expertise when rating MC. Does expertise matter for all topics? Aren't there some topics for which there are no experts? | Remember that we are not just talking about formal expertise. Informal expertise is equally important, and for some topics may be a more common type of E-E-A-T. For most page purposes and topics, you can find experts even when the field itself is niche or non-mainstream. For example, there are expert alternative medicine websites created by leading practitioners of acupuncture, herbal therapy, etc. There are also pages about alternative medicine written by people with no expertise or experience. E-E-A-T should differentiate between these two scenarios. **Reminder**: If the page is harmful to people or society, untrustworthy, or spammy as defined in these guidelines, expertise and experience doesn't matter. It should be rated Lowest. |
| When I think about E-E-A-T, it seems like expertise and experience overlap a lot. What's the difference? | Here's one way to think about it: <br> - **Expertise** often involves objective, testable knowledge or skills, for example: can you calculate the load-bearing weight of a bridge? <br> - **Experience** can be more subjective and is often shared through personal narration, for example: how does it feel to experience love for another person? For PQ rating, it's not important to distinguish between expertise and experience. Instead, focus on what kind of content is trustworthy and satisfying for the purpose of the page. You may find that both expertise and experience can be trustworthy and satisfying for the same topic. For example, a medical website may be a trustworthy source for treatment options, and the experiences of other people who have gone through treatment may provide emotional support and prepare you for what to expect. |
| Aren't some types of pages always Low quality, such as celebrity gossip? | For almost any type of page or informational topic, there is a range of content quality. For example, there are both High and Low quality celebrity gossip pages. The purpose of these pages is to share interesting, accurate information about celebrities. There may be benefits in celebrity stories that inspire others or help people going through similar challenges. A celebrity gossip page is High quality if it has accurate and interesting information, has no characteristics of Low or Lowest quality, and comes from a reasonably reliable source. |
| I've never seen a High quality page of type X. If there are no high quality pages of this type, why are we giving existing pages a Low quality rating? | For some topics or types of pages, there may not be many (or any!) High-quality pages now, but there may be in the future. We need a uniform set of standards that apply to all pages, even for pages that have not yet been created. |
| Some of these criteria seem unfair. For example, some art pages do not have a purpose. Are these pages Low quality? | Art pages do have a purpose: artistic expression. Pages created for artistic expression do not deserve the Low quality rating simply because they have no other purpose. Artistic expression, humor, entertainment, sharing photos and videos, etc. are all valid and beneficial page purposes. |
| How should interstitials factor into my rating? | Sometimes clicking on the task URL will bring up an interstitial page. You can ignore this page in your rating criteria if you can easily get to the MC. However, if the interstitial makes it extremely hard (or impossible) to get to the MC and evaluate how well the page achieves its purpose, that should factor into your PQ rating. |

Part 2: Understanding Search User Needs
________________


12.0 Understanding Search Users, Queries, and Results
Why do people search the Internet?
People use Internet search engines to perform many different tasks in different environments using different types of devices, such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, or computers. Keep in mind that searches can be simple or complex, and the underlying task that a person is trying to accomplish may take multiple steps to complete. For example, a simple task may be to find the director of a movie. A complex task may be to find a movie’s showtimes nearby, purchase tickets, and get directions to go to the theater. Overall, search engines should make it easy for people to complete tasks by surfacing helpful results right away.
________________


12.1 Important Rating Definitions and Ideas
* User: A person who is searching. People search everywhere: people in all countries, speaking all languages; people of all ages, genders, races, religions, political affiliations, etc.
* Query: The text, image, and/or other content that a user enters in a search engine search box or search app to do a search. In these guidelines, queries have square brackets around them to look like a search box. For example:
   * If a user says “coffee shops near me,” we display: [coffee shops near me].
   * If a user types “flights to New York” in the search box, we display: [flights to New York].
Queries may be spoken, typed, copied and pasted, come directly from a camera or other app, and/or be related searches that appear in search results. There are many different types of queries because people use search to do many things, from searching for specific websites to looking for answers to questions to browsing videos for inspiration to searching with an image to figure out where to buy a product.
* Query Interpretation: The possible meaning(s) of the query or what the query may refer to. Many queries have more than one meaning. For example, the query [apple] might refer to the computer brand or the fruit or something else.
* User Intent: What the user is trying to accomplish when they search. For example, if a user searches for a movie, they may be interested in showtimes, reviews, cast, etc. For a specific query interpretation, there may be many possible user intents. A single user may have many different intents for a single query!
* Locale: All queries have a locale, which is the language and region for the task. Regions are represented by a two-letter country code, for example, "US" in the locale "English (US)". We sometimes refer to the locale as the task location.
* User Location: Sometimes more specific information about the location of the person searching is provided, usually a city or state. User location is very important for understanding the query and what results are helpful for searches related to nearby places, such as [coffee shops near me]. For other searches such as [how does gravity work], user location is not important at all, as gravity works the same way everywhere.
* Search Engine Results Page (SERP): The page a search engine shows after a user enters a query in the search box. The SERP is made up of result blocks.
* Result: Refers to the result block and the landing page.
   * Result Block: An individual “block” that appears on the user’s device in response to the query. The result block may display information in the block itself or contain links, or may do both.
   * Landing Page (LP): The page you see after you click a link in the result block.
________________


12.2 Understanding the Query
Understanding the query is the first step in evaluating the task. Remember, a query is what a user types or speaks into their device. Some tasks include a query research link, which you should use if you don’t understand the query or user intent. Otherwise, please do web research using Google or an online dictionary or encyclopedia. If you still don’t understand the query or user intent, please release the task.
Important: If you research the query on Google, please do not rely on the top results on the SERP. A query may have other meanings not represented on Google’s search results pages. Do not assign a high rating to a webpage just because it appears at the top of a list of search results on Google.
Think about users in your locale typing or speaking the following queries into their phone.
Query
	User Intent
	[population of Paris], English (US)
	Find the current population of Paris, France.
	[starbucks near me], English (US)
	Find the nearest Starbucks location.
	[weather], English (US)
	Find weather information in the user location right now.
	________________


12.3 Locale and User Location
All queries have a task language and task location (referred to in rating tasks as the "Locale"). The locale is important for understanding the query and user intent. Users in different locales may have different expectations for the same query.
Some tasks show a user location in addition to a locale. However, for many or most queries in a given locale, the user location does not change our understanding of the query and user intent. Here are some examples: [facebook.com], [pictures of kittens], [distance between the earth and the moon].
When is the locale or user location important in understanding query interpretation and user intent? Please use both web research and your personal judgment to answer this question. Ask yourself, “Would people in one city or country be looking for something different than people in another city or country?”
________________


12.4 Queries with an Explicit Location
Sometimes people tell search engines exactly what kinds of results they are looking for by adding the desired location in the query, regardless of their own location. We'll call this location inside the query the “explicit location.” The explicit location makes queries much easier to understand and interpret.
Example 1:
* "My mom is coming to visit. I need to find a hotel for her nearby."
   * Query: [Dallas hotels]
   * Locale: English (US)
   * User Location: Dallas, TX
   * Explicit Location: Dallas
Example 2:
* "I need a hotel for my trip to New York."
   * Query: [New York hotels]
   * Locale: English (US)
   * User Location: Dallas, TX
   * Explicit Location: New York
Sometimes the explicit location matches the user location or locale, and sometimes it doesn't. When there is an explicit location in the query, pay attention to it! People use explicit locations to indicate exactly what they are looking for.
________________


12.5 Queries with Multiple Meanings
Many queries have more than one meaning. For example, the query [apple] might refer to the computer brand or the fruit. We will call these possible meanings query interpretations.
* Dominant Interpretation: The dominant interpretation of a query is what most users mean when they type the query. Not all queries have a dominant interpretation. The dominant interpretation should be clear to you, especially after doing a little web research.
* Common Interpretation: A common interpretation of a query is what many or some users mean when they type a query. A query can have multiple common interpretations.
* Minor Interpretation: Sometimes you will find less common interpretations. These are interpretations that fewer users have in mind. We will call these minor interpretations.
   * Reasonable minor interpretations: Reasonable minor interpretations may help fewer users, but they still are helpful to have in a set of results because different users may want different things.
   * Unlikely minor interpretations: An unlikely minor interpretation is an interpretation that is in theory possible but is very unlikely - very few users are likely to have this in mind.
   * No chance interpretation: An interpretation so unlikely that almost no user would have this in mind. Results for no chance interpretations feel off-topic even if they match the query words. For example, almost no one wants a result about an overheated pet for the English US query [hot dog].
Examples:
* Query: [apple]
   * Locale: English (US)
   * Possible Interpretations:
      * Computer company (Dominant Interpretation)
      * Fruit (Common Interpretations)
      * Person’s name (Unlikely Minor Interpretation)
      * City (Unlikely Minor Interpretation)
* Query: [mercury]
   * Locale: English (US)
   * Possible Interpretations:
      * Planet (Common Interpretations)
      * Chemical Element (Common Interpretations)
      * Insurance company (Reasonable Minor Interpretations)
      * Boat engine company (Reasonable Minor Interpretations)
      * British aircraft designed during WWII (Unlikely Minor Interpretations)
________________


12.6 Query Meanings Can Change Over Time
Remember to think about the query and its current meaning as you are rating. We will assume users are looking for current information about a topic, the most recent product model, the most recent occurrence of a recurring event, etc., unless otherwise specified by the query.
Examples:
* User in 1994
   * Query: [George Bush]
   * Locale: English (US)
   * Dominant Interpretation: 41st US president
* User in 2004
   * Query: [George Bush]
   * Locale: English (US)
   * Dominant Interpretation: 43rd US president
* User in 2007
   * Query: [iphone]
   * Locale: English (US)
   * Dominant Interpretation: iPhone 1

Sure, let's continue with the reformatting:
________________


User in 2022
* Query: [iphone]
* Locale: English (US)
* Dominant Interpretation: iPhone 13
The interpretation of the query [iphone], English (US) has changed over time as new iPhone models are released. The first iPhone was introduced in 2007. Users searching for [iphone], English (US) at that time were looking for the new (at the time) first iPhone model. Most users now are looking for the most recent or upcoming iPhone model. In the future, new models will come out and the dominant interpretation will change again.
________________


12.7 Understanding User Intent
It can be helpful to think of queries as having one or more of the following intents:
* Know query, some of which are Know Simple queries
* Do query, when the user is trying to accomplish a goal or engage in an activity
* Website query, when the user is looking for a specific website or webpage
* Visit-in-person query, some of which are looking for a specific business or organization, some of which are looking for a category of businesses
________________


12.7.1 Know and Know Simple Queries
The intent of a Know query is to find information or explore a topic. Users want to Know more about something.
Know Simple queries are a special type of Know query. Know Simple queries seek a very specific answer, like a fact, diagram, etc. This answer has to be correct and complete, and can be displayed in a relatively small amount of space. As a general rule, if most people would agree on a correct answer, and it would fit in 1-2 sentences or a short list of items, the query can be called a Know Simple query.
Examples:
* Know Simple Query: [barack obama height]
* Know Query: [barack obama]
* Explanation: The Know Simple query asks for a simple fact, which can be answered correctly and completely in a small amount of space, and the Know query answer is more complex.
________________


12.7.2 Do Queries
The intent of a Do query is to accomplish a goal or engage in an activity. The goal or activity may be to download, to buy, to obtain, to be entertained by, or to interact with a website or app. Do queries may have a specific need to be immediately accomplished or they may be more open-ended and involve browsing and subsequent searches to ultimately accomplish the goal.
Examples:
* Query: [get my GED online]
* Likely User Intent: Obtain U.S. high school equivalency diploma online.
* Query: [online personality test]
* Likely User Intent: Take an online personality test.
* Query: [what is my bmi?]
* Likely User Intent: Calculate BMI (body mass index).
* Query: [pay parking ticket]
* Likely User Intent: Pay for a parking ticket.
* Query: [watch stranger things]
* Likely User Intent: Watch the TV show “Stranger Things”.
* Query: [shape of you video]
* Likely User Intent: Watch the music video for the song “Shape of You” by Ed Sheeran
Note: This is an open-ended Do query where different kinds of content could be helpful. Some users may want to browse images and video to find visual inspiration, some may want to read how-to guides, and others may be interested in both.
________________


12.7.3 Website Queries
The intent of a Website query is to locate a specific website or webpage that users have requested. This single webpage is called the target of the query.
One type of Website query is a URL Query, which can be:
* Exact, perfectly-formed, working URLs, such as [http://www.ibm.com] or [www.ibm.com] or [ibm.com].
* Imperfect URL queries: Queries that look like URL queries, but are not “working URLs”. These URLs do not load if you type or paste them into your browser address bar. Even so, we believe users have a specific page in mind.
Examples:
* Query: [reddit login]
* Likely User Intent: View the login page for Reddit.
* Query: [tiktok]
* Likely User Intent: View the TikTok website.
* Query: [yahoo mail]
* Likely User Intent: View the Yahoo Mail website.
* Query: [walmart.com]
* Likely User Intent: View the Walmart website.
* Query: [feathermobility.com feather 13.5 lbs. wheelchair]
* Likely User Intent: View the Feather
12.7.4 Visit-in-Person Queries and User Location
People use search engines to look for Visit-in-Person information, such as finding nearby coffee shops, gas stations, ATMs, restaurants, etc.
Examples of Queries with Visit-in-Person Intent:
* Query: [car repair shop] (Locale: English (US))
* Query: [gas stations] (Locale: English (US))
* Query: [pizza], [yoga class], [grocery stores], [movie showtimes], [car repair], [dentists], [bank of america atm locations], [library near me]
Examples of Queries with Non-Visit-in-Person Intent:
* Query: [how tall is Mount Everest] (Locale: English (US))
* Query: [iq test] (Locale: English (US))
* Query: [boston red sox], [scrabble cheat], [definition of sedentary], [aapl], [beyonce], [minecraft], [small dog breeds], [dance videos], [oscars], [silly jokes], [bank of america login]
________________


12.7.5 Queries with Multiple User Intents
Many queries have more than one likely user intent. Please use your judgment when determining if a particular intent is reasonable for queries with multiple intents.
Examples:
* Query: [harvard]
   * Depending on the user need and location, users may want to visit the official homepage (Website), get directions (Visit-in-Person), or learn more information about the school such as the application process or history, see recent news, or updates on sporting events (Know).
* Query: [walmart]
   * This query is very broad. Different people may be looking for different things. However, it's fairly unlikely that someone is looking for a one specific Harvard course such as "The Science and Psychology of Music" for the broad query [harvard]. Users may want to go to a nearby Walmart (Visit-in-Person) or view the homepage to shop online (Website). Some users may want to learn more information about the company or see recent news, social media posts, etc (Know).
________________


12.8 Understanding Result Blocks
12.8.1 Web Search Result Block Examples
Web Search Result Blocks typically have a title link, a URL, and a “snippet” of text describing the page. For many queries, Web Search Result Blocks are the most helpful type of result.
Query and User Intent:
* Query: [cuisinart food processor reviews]
   * User Intent: This is a Know query. The user wants to find recent reviews of Cuisinart food processors.
   * Result: This is a Web Search Result Block that has a link to a landing page with Cuisinart reviews.
* Query: [broadway tickets]
   * User Intent: This is a Know query or Do query. The user wants to search prices and/or purchase tickets to a Broadway show in New York City.
________________


12.8.2 Special Content Result Block Examples
Special Content Result Blocks (SCRBs) appear in the search results page, along with Web Search Result Blocks.
Important: Please assume that any interactive features work and function properly. Some notes:
* All result blocks are “screenshots” or images of search results with prominent links enabled.
* There may be a delay between when the rating task is created and when you actually rate the block, causing some information in special content result blocks to be a few hours or even days out of date. Don’t penalize a special content result block for being out of date. Assume that the blocks show current information for users, unless instructed otherwise.
Query and User Intent:
* Query: [weather] (User Location: Chicago, Illinois)
   * User Intent: This is a Know Simple query since users have a fairly simple informational need: find the current temperature and chance of rain or snow.
* Query: [emma stone movies]
   * User Intent: This is a Know query. The user wants to get information on movies with Emma Stone.
   * Result: In this result block, users can immediately see some popular movies starring Emma Stone, with an option to click on the links to learn more about each movie. Users can also swipe to see a list of more movies.
* Query: [calories in a banana]
   * User Intent: This is a Know Simple query. The user wants to find out how many calories are in a banana.
Part 3: Needs Met Rating Guideline
13.0 Rating Using the Needs Met Scale
There are many different kinds of queries and results, but the process of rating is the same: Needs Met rating tasks ask you to focus on user needs and think about how helpful and satisfying the result is for the users.
This is what the Needs Met rating slider looks like:
Rating
	Description
	Fully Meets (FullyM)
	A special rating category, which only applies to queries with clear intent to find one specific result and the corresponding specific result the user is looking for.
	Highly Meets (HM)
	A very helpful result for any dominant, common or reasonable minor query interpretation/user intent.
	Moderately Meets (MM)
	A helpful result for any dominant, common or reasonable minor query interpretation/user intent.
	Slightly Meets (SM)
	A less helpful result for a dominant, common or reasonable minor interpretation/user intent OR a helpful result for an unlikely minor query interpretation/user intent.
	Fails to Meet (FailsM)
	A result that completely fails to meet the needs of all or almost all users. For example, the result may be off-topic for the query or address a no chance interpretation of the query.
	Use in-between ratings if you think the rating of a result falls between two labels. You can either drag the slider or click on the point that you want the slider to land on.
13.1 Rating Result Blocks: Block Content and Landing Pages
For Needs Met rating, you will assign a rating to each result. Each result includes the content inside the result block and landing pages associated with the result.
13.1.1 Landing Page Needs Met Ratings and Block Content Needs Met Ratings
What to Rate:
* Landing Page Needs Met ratings should be based exclusively on the landing page(s) links in the result block. This applies to both SCRBs and Web Search Result Blocks. The content that appears inside the result block should not factor into Landing Page Needs Met ratings.
* Block Content Needs Met ratings should be based exclusively on the content inside the result block. This applies to both SCRBs and Web Search Result Blocks. Do not click through to any landing pages when rating Block Content Needs Met; landing page content should not factor into Block Content Needs Met ratings.
For Web Search Result Blocks, only consider the extent to which the page title, snippet, and any visual content within the block would directly address user need.
For SCRBs, only consider the extent to which the content within the block would directly address user need.
Note: Assume that interactive result blocks function as intended. Try to interact with the result block as some links, buttons, or other features in your rating task may work.
13.2 Fully Meets (FullyM)
Fully Meets is a special rating category which only applies when all of the following are true:
* The query interpretation and user intent is specific, clear, and unambiguous.
* There is a specific website, a specific webpage, a specific know-simple fact or other specific result that all or almost all users in the rating locale and user location are looking for.
* All or almost all users in the rating locale and user location would be completely satisfied by the result.
Most queries cannot have a Fully Meets result. Most queries do not specify a single website or webpage. Most queries are not specific enough to have a single, know-simple fact as a comprehensive answer. For most queries, different people may want different types of results. For many queries, a single user may need to see many different results.
You will need to use your judgment to decide whether a result block can Fully Meet the user need. Here are some scenarios when the Fully Meets rating is appropriate:
* The user is clearly looking for a specific webpage or website and the result block with the specific webpage or website Fully Meets the user’s need.
* All or almost all users in the rating locale or user location who search for this query would be looking for the same, specific fact or piece of information. The result block provides the information thoroughly, accurately, and clearly, and is from a trustworthy source acceptable for all or almost all users. Before using the Fully Meets rating for queries seeking a very specific fact or piece of information, you must check for accuracy and confirm that the information is supported by expert consensus where such consensus exists.
Be conservative when using the Fully Meets rating. Even queries that seem to have a single right "answer" may benefit from more perspectives to satisfy all or almost all users. When in doubt, use a lower rating.
Note: If a result block is very close to being fully satisfying, but the block alone may not be sufficient in order to fully satisfy all or almost all users, a rating of Highly Meets or Highly Meets+ may be appropriate.
13.2.1 Examples of Fully Meets (FullyM) Result Blocks
Query and User Intent:
* Query: [amazon]
   * User Intent: Go to the Amazon website.
   * Fully Meets Explanation: The query has clear intent to go to the amazon.com website. While there may be other interpretations for the query, the dominant one is by far the website.
* Query: [target website]
   * User Intent: Go to the Target website.
   * Fully Meets Explanation: The query has clear intent to go to target.com.
* Query: [titanic imdb]
   * User Intent: Go to the IMDb page for Titanic.
   * Fully Meets Explanation: The query has clear intent to go to the IMDb page for Titanic.

13.2.2 Examples of Queries that Cannot Have Fully Meets Results
Type of Query:
* Broad queries where no single result could fully satisfy all users
   * Example: [knitting]
   * No Fully Meets Result: Explanation: This is a broad informational query. Knitting is an activity anyone can do and that anyone can create a website for. Different users may want different types of content: videos, instructions, patterns, etc. There is no one official source for knitting information and no one result could satisfy most users. Therefore, no Fully Meets result is possible for this query.
* Ambiguous queries without a clear user intent or dominant interpretation
   * Example: [ada]
   * No Fully Meets Result: Explanation: There is no dominant interpretation for this query. The following entities are all common interpretations: Americans with Disabilities Act, American Dental Association, and American Diabetes Association. While each interpretation has an official homepage, none is Fully Meets since there is no dominant interpretation.
* Queries for people’s names can be tricky.
   * Example: [sam wen]
   * No Fully Meets Result: Explanation: Many or most people queries do not have a dominant interpretation. Even unusual sounding name queries may not have a dominant interpretation. For example, the queries [sam wen], [tran nguyen], and [david mease] can have no Fully Meets result because there are multiple people with each of these names, and it is not clear that most users are looking for any one particular individual.
13.3 Highly Meets (HM)
A rating of Highly Meets is assigned to very helpful results for any dominant, common, or reasonable minor interpretation or user intent of the query.
Highly Meets results are highly satisfying and a good “fit” for reasonable interpretations and intents. In addition, they often have some of the following characteristics (depending on the query):
* Entertaining or enjoyable for queries with a reasonable entertainment intent.
* Representative of the opinions, perspectives, and experience of real people for queries with no single right answer.
* For informational queries, very helpful results that, for example:
   * Are easy to understand the content, e.g., helpful images or videos, an easy to understand summary.
   * Provide in-depth or insightful content, e.g., a deep dive explanation, an expert analysis.
* For queries that benefit from recently created content, fresh results that provide up-to-date content on “what everyone is talking about right now” e.g., breaking news on a topic or the latest viral video or a hot new fashion trend.
Highly Meets results may be any type of content: articles, short form or long form video, images, social media posts, forum discussions, etc. There is no length requirement for Highly Meets results. Sometimes what makes a result satisfying is that it is short and easy to understand. Other results may be very satisfying because of the depth and richness of content. For some queries, comprehensiveness may be critically important, such as queries about truly complex topics or YMYL queries for which a short answer could be misleading.
Accuracy is required for Highly Meets informational results. Highly Meets information pages on YMYL topics must be accurate and trustworthy. Highly Meets medical and scientific information pages must represent well-established scientific/medical consensus unless the user is clearly seeking an alternative viewpoint.
A query can have many Highly Meets results. Search engines should strive to provide a diverse set of Highly Meets results from a variety of websites in a variety of content types from a variety of people and perspectives. This is especially important for queries with no single, "right answer", subjective queries, queries with multiple intents and interpretations, queries seeking opinions and perspectives, and queries simply looking to browse or explore the web.
For most queries, Highly Meets is the highest possible rating a result can receive. Results rated Highly Meets represent the most helpful content available for a given query interpretation and user intent. Some queries have several Highly Meets results because there is a variety of very helpful content available on the internet that addresses reasonable query interpretations and user intents. Other queries may have no Highly Meets results at all because very helpful content doesn't exist on the internet or search engines are unable to find it. The standard for Highly Meets is very high.
13.3.1 Examples of Highly Meets (HM) Result Blocks

________________


13.4 Moderately Meets (MM)
A rating of Moderately Meets is assigned to helpful results for any reasonable interpretation or user intent of the query, including reasonable minor interpretations and intents.
Moderately Meets results have fewer valuable attributes than Highly Meets results. Moderately Meets results should still “fit” the query, but they are less satisfying than Highly Meets results. For example:
* Moderately Meets results may be less representative of the opinions, perspectives, and experience of real people for queries with no single right answer.
* For informational queries, Moderately Meets results might have content that is slightly harder to understand than Highly Meets results.
* Moderately Meets results may be slightly out of date for queries that benefit from recently created content.
A query can have many Moderately Meets results. Moderately Meets results exist in all formats (video, audio, text, image) and on many types of websites: professional websites, corporate websites, forums, social media, etc.
Moderately Meets is an acceptable rating if you see aspects of the result that are Highly Meets but other aspects seem Slightly Meets.
There is nothing "wrong" with Moderately Meets results. Moderately Meets results are not out-of-date or inaccurate. Moderately Meets results are generally average to good.

13.5 Slightly Meets (SM)
A rating of Slightly Meets is assigned to results that are less helpful for a reasonable query interpretation or user intent. A rating of Slightly Meets is also assigned to a helpful result for an unlikely query interpretation or intent or be related to the user’s information need without directly addressing the core of the need. Slightly Meets results may have some aspect that prevents a higher rating, for example, they may have outdated information. Slightly Meets results may not fully address an important part of the query or otherwise be less helpful for users.
A query can have many Slightly Meets results. Slightly Meets results exist in all formats (video, audio, text, image) and on many types of websites: professional websites, corporate websites, forums, social media, etc.
Often there is nothing "wrong" with Slightly Meets results - they may simply be a less helpful "fit" for the particular query in the rating task. A Slightly Meets result for one query may be a Highly Meets result for a different query.
Important: Many users decide which result to click or tap on based on the content in the result block, such as the title of the web result on the search results page. (Note that these titles usually come from webpages.) A result with a very misleading or exaggerated title should be rated Slightly Meets or lower, due to the poor user experience that occurs when the landing page does not match the expectation of the user when clicking or tapping on the result.

   * User Intent: Find information about Britney Spears (e.g., current news, pictures).

   * User Intent: We will assume that users are interested in the current Honda Odyssey model, unless specified otherwise.

3. Query: [hot dog]
   * User Intent: Find information about hot dogs, such as recipes or nutrition information.

13.6 Fails to Meet (FailsM)
A rating of Fails to Meet should be assigned to results that fail to meet the needs of all or almost all users. Fails to Meet results have some aspect that causes them to be unhelpful for the query, such as a lack of attention to an aspect of the query (or user location) that is critical for satisfying the user intent. Fails to Meet may also be used for results that have incorrect or very outdated information. Fails to Meet results may be helpful for a no chance interpretation. Fails to Meet results may be off-topic for any query interpretation.
Search results should never surprise people with unpleasant, upsetting, offensive, or disturbing content. For this reason, all of the following types of content should be rated Fails to Meet if it is clear that the user is not looking for such content:
* Harmful to Self or Other Individuals (Section 4.2)
* Harmful to Specified Groups (Section 4.3)

   * User Location: Naperville, Illinois

13. Query: [amazon]
   * User Location: Austin, Texas
   * User Intent: Go to the Amazon website.
   * Result: Showing information about how to visit or call the corporate office for an online company would not be helpful. At the time this example was written, the Amazon corporate office was not open to the public; very, very few people ever go to an Amazon corporate office.

16. Query: [tooth loss five years old]
   * User Intent: Find information about tooth loss in a five-year-old child.

According to the airline’s website, the correct phone number is 1-888-247-2262. Because this answer is incorrect, it should be rated Fails to Meet.
   * Rating: Fails to Meet
   * Explanation: This result Fails to Meet the needs of the user.
21. 

Query: [miley cyrus] (continued)
   * User Intent: Find information about the American singer/actress Miley Cyrus, such as biographical info, discography/filmography, current news, etc.
   * Rating: Fails to Meet
   * Explanation: This result is useless. Just because a website has the look and feel of a traditional news site does NOT mean that you should consider the reporting to be factually accurate without further research. Watch out for sites that present themselves as news, but were actually created with the intent to mislead or misinform users.
   22. Query: [who is hitler's daughter]
   * User Intent: Find the name of or information about Adolf Hitler's daughter, if Hitler in fact had a daughter.
   * Result: This LP is a blog post presenting a factually unsupported conspiracy theory that Angela Merkel is the daughter of Adolph Hitler. Because the MC is inaccurate and misleading, it completely Fails to Meet the user intent, even though the topic of the page matches the query.
   * Rating: Fails to Meet
   * Explanation: A more helpful result for this query might confirm that Adolf Hitler had no children, or provide information on the novel Hitler's Daughter by Jackie French.
14.0 The Relationship between Page Quality and Needs Met
The Needs Met rating is based on both the query and the result. You must carefully think about the query and user intent when assigning a Needs Met rating.
The Page Quality rating slider does not depend on the query. Do not think about the query when assigning a Page Quality rating to the LP.
Some results don’t have a Page Quality slider. If a result block has no Page Quality rating slider, you do not have to give a Page Quality rating. If there is a Page Quality slider, please assign a Page Quality rating based on the landing page.
Here is some guidance about assigning Needs Met and Page Quality ratings:
   * Useless results should always be rated FailsM, even if the landing page has a high Page Quality rating. Useless is useless.
   * The HM rating is not appropriate if a page is untrustworthy or has any other undesirable characteristics, such as outdated or inaccurate information. There are very high standards for the HM rating.
   * A page can have such low Page Quality that it is unhelpful or even harmful, such as gibberish pages or scams. These types of extremely low quality pages should be rated FailsM because the Page Quality issues interfere with helpfulness. (An exception is queries with clear website intent, where the target website should be rated FullyM. People are allowed to search for any website and search engines should honor that intent when it is clear.)
Examples of Needs Met and Page Quality Ratings
   1. Query: [symptoms of dehydration]
   * User Intent: Find information about the symptoms of dehydration.
   * Result:
   * Needs Met: Even though the article is topical, the information is not trustworthy and is potentially misleading or harmful. This result is unhelpful for the query.
   * Page Quality: This is a YMYL topic. This page has no evidence of medical expertise/authority and is not trustworthy.
   2. Query: [how many octaves on a guitar]
   * User Intent: Find out the number of octaves on a guitar.
   * Result:
   * Needs Met: This is a very helpful result for the query.
   * Page Quality: This is a YMYL topic. This page is on a highly authoritative medical website and has a lot of reliable and accurate MC. This page is very trustworthy.
   * Needs Met: This block shows the number of octaves on a piano, not a guitar. Even though this block has a link to a high quality landing page about pianos, the information shown in the block is inaccurate with respect to the query. This result Fails to Meet the user need.
   * Page Quality: There is a lot of helpful MC on the landing page. The page has medium to high E-E-A-T. Medium+ to High is an appropriate rating.
16.0 Many Types of Helpful Results
Some queries may have many different possible meanings, or people may be looking for different things. Make sure to give Highly Meets ratings to very helpful results for all reasonable interpretations and intents, including reasonable minor interpretations.
Many queries have different possible meanings or interpretations. Don't assume – do query research! Results for a diverse set of reasonable interpretations may be very helpful.
For any given query interpretation, different users may have different intents. For example, different people who search for [avatar] with the movie in mind could be seeking different kinds of information about the movie. Some may be seeking reviews, others could want to see what people are saying on social media, while others still could be interested in the cast or ways to watch the movie, etc. Results that satisfy different reasonable intents may be very helpful to different users.
It’s also possible for a single user to have many different intents for any given query interpretation. That is, one person searching [avatar] could be broadly interested in the movie, and that person might want to browse reviews and social media posts, see the cast, and find out how to watch the movie. A diverse set of results that satisfy different reasonable intents may be very helpful to individual users, too!
Results of different types may be helpful for many kinds of queries, including queries with a single, clear interpretation or intent. Consider what kinds of results are helpful for all queries you rate, including:
   * Different formats (e.g., text, video, image, audio)
   * Different experiences, perspectives, and opinions (e.g., a personal blog or a social media post)
   * Different content depths (e.g., the 10-second summary video and the 1-hour deep dive documentary)
   * Different types of sites: corporate, not-for-profit, government, social media, forums, personal blogs, etc.
Make sure all types of very helpful results get a Highly Meets rating. Some queries may benefit from a wide variety of helpful results:
   * Queries that seek experiences, opinions, and perspectives, such as [should I get a dog], [what does love feel like]
   * Queries that are subjective, such as [best music to run to]
   * Exploration and browsing queries – users may need to see many different options, such as [ideas for bathroom remodel], [black suit], [inexpensive engagement rings]
   * Queries with no single, right answer, such as [how to ask your boss for a raise]
16.1 Rating Queries with Both Website and Visit-in-Person Intent
Some queries have two possible strong intents:
   1. Go to the website intent: in order to, for example, find out information, buy something online, make a reservation, schedule an appointment, interact with customer support, or fulfill some other need that can be satisfied online
   2. Visit-in-person intent: user wants to visit the store, business, etc. in person
For these queries, result blocks that only satisfy one intent should NOT get a Fully Meets rating.
Query and User Intent | Result Block and LP | Needs Met Rating and Explanation
   1. Query: [target]
   * User Location: Jacksonville, Florida
   * User Intent: There are two possible strong user intents: most users probably want to visit a nearby Target location or go to the website to shop online, research products, find prices, etc.

   * User Intent: There are two possible strong user intents: most users probably want to visit a nearby Citibank location or go to the website to bank online.
   * Result Block:
   * The result block shows three nearby Citibank locations in the user location of Palo Alto. The information is especially helpful for users who want to visit the bank. This fulfills the user intent to find a nearby Citibank location.
   * Needs Met Rating: The result is very satisfying and fulfills the user intent to do online banking or otherwise use the website.
17.0 Specificity of Queries and Landing Pages
Some queries are very general and some queries are specific. Here are some examples that compare levels of specificity of English (US) queries:
Query | More Specific Query | Even More Specific Query
   * [chair]
   * [dining room chair]
   * [ikea “henriksdal” highback upholstered chair]
   * [library]
   * [harvard library]
   * [harvard anthropology library]
   * [restaurants]
   * [chinese restaurants]
   * [takeout chinese restaurants in downtown Austin]
   * [coffee shops]
   * [starbucks]
   * [red rock coffee mountain view]
   * [interview questions]
   * [interview questions for teachers]
   * [practice interview questions used for teach for america]
Results for specific queries are easier to rate on the Needs Met scale because we know more about what the user is looking for. Giving a Needs Met rating for results for general queries can be difficult. As always, your rating is based on how helpful the result is for the query, not the specificity fit.
When the query is a broad category, such as [cafes] [restaurants] [hotels] [books] [tourist attractions in paris], etc., popular and prominent examples may be considered very helpful. Please do web research to help you understand what is popular and prominent in different locations.

18.0 Needs Met Rating and Freshness
Some queries demand very recent or “fresh” information. Users may be looking for “breaking news,” such as an important event or natural disaster happening right now. Here are different types of queries demanding current/recent results:
Type of Query | Example Queries | Explanation
   * “Breaking news” queries
   * [tornado], [tsunami]
   * Explanation: Assume users need the information right away. Imagine someone who needs immediate weather information because a big storm is coming. Information about last year's weather would not be helpful.
   * Recurring event queries, such as elections, sports events, TV shows, conferences, etc.
   * [olympics], [american idol], [redsox schedule], [tax forms], [elections]
   * Explanation: Assume users are looking for the most recent or current information about the event. For example, if the Olympics are happening right now, users searching [olympics] want information about the current Olympics, not results from years ago. If the next Olympics are a few months away, users are probably interested in the upcoming Olympics.
   * Current information queries
   * [population of paris], [amount of u.s. debt], [airfare from ny to sfo], [next federal holiday]
   * Explanation: Assume users are looking for the most current information, such as prices or airfare.
   * Product queries
   * [iphone], [toyota camry], [windows operating system]
   * Explanation: Assume users are looking for information about the most recent model/version for these product queries.
When a query demands recent content, only pages with current, recent, or updated content should get high Needs Met ratings. For these queries, pages about past events, old product models and prices, outdated information, etc., are not helpful. They should be considered “stale” and given low Needs Met ratings. In some cases, stale results are useless and should be rated FailsM.
For some queries, there may be “newsy” or recent information user intent, as well as more “timeless” information user intent. Users issuing queries for celebrities or politicians may be interested in biographical information, or users may be looking for the latest news or gossip.
Freshness is generally less of a concern for Page Quality rating. “Stale” pages can have high Page Quality ratings. For example, some highly reputable news websites maintain “archival” content. However, unmaintained/abandoned “old” websites or unmaintained and inaccurate/misleading content is a reason for a low Page Quality rating.
Note: The date the page was created may be different from when the content was last updated or modified. When content is updated, the page will sometimes show the date of the update, not the date the page was created. Some websites always show the current date, regardless of when the content was last updated. If you are curious about the content of a page, see here to try the “Wayback Machine” on the Internet Archive. Not all pages are available, but this tool may help you understand how some pages were created and how their content has changed over time.
Query and User Intent | Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating, Page Quality Rating | Explanation
   1. Query: [los angeles traffic]
   * User Location: Los Angeles, California
   * User Intent: Users are looking for current information about traffic conditions in Los Angeles. Even pages about traffic conditions the day before would be considered stale for the query.
   * Result 1:
   * Needs Met: This LP shows traffic conditions in Los Angeles on August 7, 2012, which is the day this example was written.
   * Result 2:
   * Needs Met: This LP shows traffic conditions in Los Angeles on August 6, 2012. It is stale and useless for the query even though it is only one day old.
   2. Query: [nobel peace prize winner]
   * User Intent: Find the name of the most recent winner of this prize. This is a Know Simple query. At the time this example was originally written, 2011 was the most recent year that the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded.
   * Result 1:
   * Needs Met: This LP on the New York Times website has information about the most recent winner of this prize, based on the date when this example was written.
   * Result 2:
   * Needs Met: This LP on the BBC website has information about the 2006 winner of this prize. The 2006 winners of the prize may be an extremely minor interpretation of the query, so this page is stale for the query.
   3. Query: [arthritis]
   * User Intent: Users are looking for information about this disease. Because there is ongoing research done on treatments and cures for most diseases, users are probably looking for authoritative, up-to-date information on arthritis.
   * Result 1:
   * Needs Met: Medline Plus is an authoritative website that regularly updates its content.
   * Result 2:
   * Needs Met: This 2006 article is extremely stale for this medical query. For this type of query, old medical news is generally unhelpful and potentially dangerous.
   4. Query: [when was franklin d roosevelt born]
   * User Intent: Users want to find this well-understood fact.
   * Result 1:
   * Needs Met: This LP has the information users are looking for. This query does not require fresh results.
   * Result 2:
   * Needs Met: We couldn’t find a stale page for this query. N/A.
19.0 Misspelled and Mistyped Queries and Results
19.1 Misspelled and Mistyped Queries
You will notice that some queries are misspelled or mistyped. Here are some examples of queries that are obviously misspelled:
Misspelled Query | Query Interpretation
   * [federal expres], English (US): The only reasonable query interpretation is the company named Federal Express.
   * [new england patroits], English (US): The only reasonable interpretation is the NFL football team.
   * [byonce knowles], English (US): The only reasonable interpretation is the famous singer/actress, Beyonce Knowles.
Some misspelled or mistyped queries are more difficult to interpret. Use your judgment and do query research.
For obviously misspelled or mistyped queries, you should base your rating on user intent, not necessarily on exactly how the query has been spelled or typed by the user.
For queries that are not obviously misspelled or mistyped, you should respect the query as written and assume users are looking for results for the query as it is spelled.
19.2 Name Queries
Query and Possible User Intents | Query Interpretation
   * Query: [mich ea l jordan], English (US): There are many people named “Micheal Jordan.”
   * Explanation: Helpful results for more prominent people named Micheal Jordan should receive higher ratings than helpful results for less prominent people named Micheal Jordan. Because Michael Jordan is such a famous athlete/celebrity, we will consider Michael Jordan to be an unlikely minor interpretation.
Consider the query [john stuart], English (US). There is a very famous Jon Stewart, the comedian and former host of a popular U.S. television show. However, we should not assume that the query [john stuart] has been misspelled. There are many people named John Stuart. We will respect the query as written and assume the user is looking for someone named “John Stuart.”
Query and User Intent | Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating, Page Quality Rating | Explanation
   1. Query: [mich ea l jordan]
   * User Intent: There are many people named “Micheal Jordan.”
   * Result 1:
   * Needs Met: The page lists all members of the LinkedIn site named “Micheal Jordan.” LinkedIn is a very popular social networking website for professionals in the U.S. This result would be very helpful for users trying to find information about someone named “Micheal Jordan.”
   * Result 2:
   * Needs Met: This is a somewhat helpful result for an unlikely minor interpretation of the query.
20.0 Non-Fully Meets Results for URL Queries
Raters sometimes ask the question, “For a well-formed working URL query, are the only acceptable Needs Met ratings for a result either Fully Meets or Fails to Meet?” The answer is no. There can be other helpful results for URL queries.
Finding information about a website is a reasonable interpretation and intent for URL queries, as some users issue URL queries to find information about a website, such as reviews or recent news. We recommended this to you as one method of reputation research in the PQ guidelines. Real users do this too. Results that give reviews and reputation information can be very helpful for a URL query.
However, websites that offer usage statistics about a website are not usually helpful results for URL queries. Most users aren’t interested in this kind of information.
Query and User Intent | Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating, Page Quality Rating | Explanation
   1. Query: [potterybarn.com]
   * User Intent: Pottery Barn is a home furnishing store. Users may want to go to the website, do research, or find more information on the company.
   * Result 1:
   * Needs Met: This LP is the target of the query.
   * Result 2:
   * Needs Met: Online coupon codes are very popular in the U.S. and this LP (from a well-known coupon site) displays codes for online purchases on the Pottery Barn website. Users may be interested in coupon codes and this would be very helpful for those shopping online at potterybarn.com, especially frequent shoppers.
   * Result 3:
   * Needs Met: This LP (from a well-known review site) has reviews of the potterybarn.com website. Users may be interested in reading reviews when considering whether to make purchases at potterybarn.com, especially new shoppers.
   2. Query: [ratemyprofessors.com]
   * User Intent: Go to www.ratemyprofessors.com, a website where students can rate their college professors.
   * Result 1:
   * Needs Met: This LP is the target of the query.
   * Result 2:
   * Needs Met: This LP is an extensive encyclopedia article for the queried URL. It contains many helpful sections, including information detailing the rating process, comparison with in-class evaluations, criticism, etc. This is a very helpful result for a reasonable interpretation of the query.
21.0 Product Queries: Importance of Browsing and Researching
Some product queries, such as [ipad reviews], have a clear information-seeking (Know) intent. Other product queries, such as [buy ipad], have a clear purchase (Do) intent. And some product queries, such as [ipad store.apple.com], have a clear navigation (Website) intent. However, most product queries don’t obviously specify one type of intent.
Keep in mind that many users enjoy browsing and visually exploring products online, similar to window shopping in real life. Give high Needs Met ratings to results that allow users to research, browse, and decide what to purchase.
Users may not always plan to buy products online that they are browsing and researching, for example, cars or major appliances. Even though the ultimate goal may be to purchase a product, many other activities may take place first: researching the product (reviews, technical specifications), understanding the options that are available (brands, models, pricing), viewing and considering various options (browsing), etc.
Important: Page Quality ratings for product results need extra care and attention.
Query and User Intent | Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating, Page Quality Rating | Explanation
   1. Query: [high definition tv]
   * User Intent: This query doesn’t specify a size or brand of TV. Users are probably doing research before making a purchase.
   * Result 1:
   * Needs Met: This LP has comprehensive information about different types of high definition TVs (plasma, LCD, LED), as well as reviews about many specific models. The website is known for having helpful reviews and information about electronics.
   2. Query: [girl toddler jeans size 3T]
   * User Intent: The query is very specific. The user wants to browse and find an item to buy.
   * Result 1:
   * Needs Met: This is a helpful page for browsing and shopping for toddler girls jeans. There are many options for jeans in size 3T. This is a high-quality store known for selling jeans.
   3. Query: [cufflinks] (continued)
   * User Intent: Most users probably want to find different cufflink styles and options to browse or purchase.
   * Result 1:
   * Needs Met: This LP has a large collection of cufflinks from a very reputable retailer. There are many options and styles. This is a good page for browsing. There are helpful features at the top to choose styles, price ranges, etc.
   4. Query: [twist of fate ring pandora]
   * User Intent: The user is looking for a specific ring sold by the Pandora brand and likely wants to research the ring, see what it looks like, find options to browse or purchase, etc.
   * Result 1:
   * Needs Met: This result has a variety of images of the ring, showing different angles and materials. Knowing what the ring looks like is very helpful to users who are researching the product and browsing options that are available.
22.0 Rating Visit-in-Person Intent Queries
When there is a user location for a visit-in-person intent query and a location has not been specified in the query itself, such as [chinese restaurants] with a user location of Boston, MA, results in or near the user location are the most helpful.
How close is “near”? The type of business and/or entity should be taken into consideration when deciding if the distance of the visit-in-person result is too far. For example, most people are not willing to travel very far for a gas station, coffee shop, supermarket, etc. Those are types of businesses that most users expect to find nearby.
However, users might be willing to travel a little farther for certain kinds of visit-in-person results: doctors’ offices, libraries, specific types of restaurants, public facilities like swimming pools, hiking trails in open spaces, etc. Sometimes users may accept results that are even farther away, such as a very specialized medical clinic.
In other words, when we say users are looking for results “nearby,” the word “nearby” can mean different distances for different queries. As always, please use your judgment.
22.1 Examples Where User Location Does (and Does Not) Matter
As previously mentioned, the user location may not always change our understanding of the query and user intent. Below is one example where user location plays an important role, and two examples where user location does not matter.
Query and User Intent | Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating | Explanation
   1. Query: [minimum wage rate]
   * User Location: Wichita, Kansas
   * User Intent: Find out what the current minimum wage is. Different states in the U.S. have different minimum wage rates. Users might be interested in the minimum wage in their state and how it compares to other places.
   * Result 1:
   * Needs Met: This result block displays the complete and correct answer prominently in the result block, in a way that is easy for users on mobile devices to read. (Assume that the result shows current information for users at the time this example was written. If you were rating this task, you would need to verify that the minimum wage rate in this result block is accurate for the state of Kansas.)
   * Result 2:
   * Needs Met: This is the official Kansas state website page on minimum wage for Kansas.
   * Result 3:
   * Needs Met: This LP has the minimum wage rates for all states. It is on the official U.S. Department of Labor website. Though it takes some work to find the information specific to Kansas, this is a very helpful result for users seeking general information about the minimum wage rate.
   * Result 4:
   * Needs Met: This is the official California state website page on minimum wage for California. Given the user location, this is an unhelpful result.
   2. Query: [amazon jobs]
   * User Location: Miami, Florida
   * User Intent: Users are looking for job opportunities at Amazon.
   * Result 1:
   * Needs Met: The user is looking for a job at Amazon and there is no information in this result block that will help the user explore job opportunities—it Fails to Meet the user need.
   * Result 2:
   * Needs Met: This is Amazon’s official page on careers and jobs at Amazon, where users can search for currently open opportunities. This page is exactly what the user is looking for—it Fully Meets the user need.
24.0 Rating Dictionary and Encyclopedia Results for Different Queries
When assigning Needs Met ratings for dictionary and encyclopedia results, careful attention must be paid to the user intent. Like all results, the helpfulness of dictionary and encyclopedia results depend on the query and user intent.
Dictionary and encyclopedia results may be topically relevant for many searches, but often these results are not helpful for common words that most people in your rating locale already understand. Reserve high Needs Met ratings for dictionary and encyclopedia results when the user intent for the query is likely "what is it" or "what does it mean" and the result is helpful for users seeking that type of information.
Important: Think about how helpful it is to get dictionary or encyclopedia results for very common words. Often there may be much more likely and reasonable intents. If you think most people know the meaning of the word and it is unlikely that people would be looking for the definition, a Slightly Meets rating may be appropriate.
Query and User Intent | Result Block and LP, Needs Met Rating | Explanation
   1. Query: [obsequious]
   * User Intent: Users are probably looking for the definition of this vocabulary word.
   * Result 1:
   * Needs Met: This is a vocabulary word often studied in secondary school and found on college entrance exams. Many users may be looking for a definition and would find this dictionary result helpful.
   2. Query: [rainbow]
   * User Intent: This is a broad query. Users could be looking for many things, including images of rainbows, brands or local stores/organizations with "rainbow" in their name, etc.
   * Result 1:
   * Needs Met: Most users probably already know what a rainbow is and would not be looking for a definition. Even if the user needs help understanding the word, images or a simple description would be more helpful than this dictionary result.
   3. Query: [cafeteria]
   * User Location: Eugene, Oregon
   * User Intent: Most English-speaking users in the US are familiar with cafeterias. Users are most likely looking for a place to eat.
   * Result 1:
   * Needs Met: Most users are looking for a place to eat rather than general information about cafeterias. Even though this is an in-depth encyclopedia article that matches the topic of the query, this is not a very helpful result.
   4. Query: [history of ATM machines]
   * User Intent: Find information about the history of ATM machines (e.g., the inventor, when it was invented, its evolution, etc.).
   * Result 1:
   * Needs Met: The user wants to learn more information about the history of ATM machines. This encyclopedia article includes an extensive section on ATM machine history. This is a very helpful result.
   5. Query: [atm near me]
   * User Location: Livingston, Wyoming
   * User Intent: Find ATMs near the user location.
   * Result 1:
   * Needs Met: The user intent is to find a nearby ATM machine. This encyclopedia article fails to meet the need of the user because it has no information about nearby ATM locations.
